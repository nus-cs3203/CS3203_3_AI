3803,Why can nobody understand what I say?,"Excuse me for venting, but I just need to bitch about this. I'm an American who has been here for about 4 years. I'm not FT, not rich, live in Sembawang area, etc. I try my best to blend in. I take public transport, I mostly eat at hawker stands and try and be patient. However, it's really becoming an annoying trend in that many people don't understand what I am saying. Specifically taxi uncles or those who work at places like Kopitiams. I understand I can talk fast, so I go out of my way to slow it down and enunciate, but it doesn't seem to help.Here is a typical exchange when entering a taxi.Me: Hello Uncle, can I go to Hougang?Uncle: Huh? *Actually, it's not ""huh,"" it's more like a guttural ""AAAH?""*Me: Can I go to Hougang please?Uncle: AHH? Havelock?Me: HOW-GUNG..HOW-GUNG HOW-GUNG.Uncle: Ok, you show me the way ahh?This happens in nearly every taxi I enter, regardless of where I am going. I have to keep repeating myself, despite speaking English slowly and clearly.Nearly every time I go to a Kopitiam, like my meal tonight which ultimately led to this post.Me: Can I have one bubur pulut hitam?Lady: AHH?Me: Can I have one Bu-bur-pu-lut-hi-tam?Lady: GHSGJHSGHJSG AH?Me: Sure*As she is pouring it into the bowl*Me: Can I have extra coconut cream?Lady: AHH? Me: Extra coconut cream pleaseLady: Extra Ahh? *Dips ladle in to get extra juice from the pot of bubur pulut hitam and makes the dish super watered down.*She then pours one little spoon of cream on top, when I have basically begged to have extra at this point. She then just hands it to me and says ""Ok Ahh?"" No, it's not fucking OK. However, talking to this woman at this point would just further frustrate me and probably land me on Stomp.Another example at the Kopitiam...a different stall. I'm ordering food and I ask the man if the curry is Chicken. ""Yes yes chicken yes."" I ask, is it boneless? ""AHHH?"" Is it boneless or does it have bones in it, the chicken? He just scoops up some and holds it there for me to look at, which does nothing to answer my question.Ok, now look. I understand it may seem trivial, but it's really starting to frustrate me to the point that it's pissing me the fuck off. I'm not stupid, I don't speak like I have shit in my mouth, aside from ""American,"" I have no crazy accent. I'm speaking clearly, and loud enough for normal people to hear. What the fuck is so different that I keep running into these same problems with people at hawker stands and in taxis? I'm paying to get food, or to use a service, and I would like to receive that food or service a specific way, that is well within reason. However, these people make it so difficult, that the entire experience just leaves me pissed off and I regret going in the first place.Excuse me if this makes me sound like an asshole, but Singapore's official language is English, correct? Then why can't these people in these positions have a basic comprehension of it? Am I being unreasonable?",0.6808004975318909,Transportation,0.9969567656517028,"Food Services,Housing,Employment,Financial,Infrastructure,Retail,Recreation,Public Safety,Technology,Noise,Education,Social Services,Healthcare,Environmental"

680,Honest question: how homophobic is Singapore?,"I'm an American software engineer looking for jobs in other countries, and I know Singapore is very immigrant friendly.  The trouble is, I've heard it's very homophobic as well.  A quick wiki search informed me that it is indeed illegal, but also that nobody's been arrested for it in some time.  Are there any gay Singaporeans here who can comment on how comfortable you are there, or any expats that can comopare Singapore to their home country in this regard?  I realize public displays of affection are probably completely off limits, but is it possible that I could lose my job or get arrested on suspicion of being gay, even if it's kept private?

3118,SingTel home broadband - horrendous network and service?,"Been here a week and could find why Singaporeans love to hate SingTel. The fixed line home broadband connectivity is so horrible! I bet it's a lot better service in Tanzania. Even in a third-world country like India one gets a decent enough service at comparable rates. Upon digging a little into the issue it looks like DNS servers by SingTel are the cause. They time out very often. Users constantly get a 'host not reachable' page. The 2wire ADSL modems too seem to be hopeless as shit. Any inherent problems with it? Sites like google.com /youtube are not accessible! Shit's that fucked up! SingTel service folks seem to have no clue about what that is. ""please restart ah! it would work!"" is the response. I guess those who are here for a short while are just forced to put up with this shit considering that prepaid mobile broadband is pricey. And I guess that sucks even more. /rant",0.6606544256210327,Technology,0.964823305606842,Infrastructure

I understand there's an economies of scale effect but this should easily be offset by the much cheaper transportation from China/Taiwan where they make the parts.There definitely seems to be some sort of cartelisation going on in Sim Lim, either by retailers or wholesalers.

3776,What things about Singapore irk you?,"Yes, I do complain about the usual stuff like weather and the *government* but there is this one thing which irritates the heck out of me. The level of graciousness is appalling. From driving on the roads to giving up seats to those more in need. I've seen able-bodied men snatch seats from women, on trains and buses. I've seen people pretending to sleep or not acknowledging their surroundings when there are people more in need of the seats. Everyone knows how drivers are on the roads here so I won't elaborate, but there's one thing I want to highlight, that is - pedestrians having to watch out for cars and sometimes worry that the car won't slow down at zebra crossings! When entering places, some people don't even bother to hold the door open for the next person when they are right behind them. Edit: when on a two way walkway keep to one side and not make people walking in the opposite direction have to squeeze their way through, even when walking up overhead bridges. When on a public bus, not seating on the outer seat when no one is on the inner one. Not standing in front of the bus stop when 10 plus people behind you are trying to look out for their buses.This problem might have stemmed from school (primary and secondary), where we aim to be the best and not care about who falls along the wayside. It might be what was taught to us since young, by our parents and teachers and actions of older generations. It might have been many other reasons. Being gracious can actually brighten a person's day, and I really feel Singaporeans do need brightening up.
