But after the tenth day, I realised my number still wasn't ported. I made a call to them regarding this and they gave the silly excuse that they're undergoing some system upgrade/maintainence. So I waited and waited. Finally they sent me a text saying that my number has been ported successfully. Problem solved? Not quite.I found out that I could make outgoing calls and send outgoing text. But neither incoming calls nor text are working for me. It's been 7 days and counting that I'm living with this problem.Their customer service has been giving me the run around; Each time I gave them a call, their response is always one of these: 1)We would check on the problem and give you a call back, which they never did. 2) We have resetted your line and it would work in 24hrs. Yea, right, we're still here aren't we.I'm contemplating going down to their service centre to cancel my service with them and return the phone for a full refund. I have been with Singtel and M1 and I have to say, this is really, really atrocious. How could you let your customer not be contactable for a week and blame all this on system upgrades?

I have a couple of questions which I hope some of you may be able to answer.* My results are 1 point worse than the cut-off for my desired JC, what are my chances of making it in if I appeal?* What are the following schools like in terms of environment, teachers and curriculum:    1. Meridian JC    2. Nanyang JC    3. Catholic JC    4. Millennia Institute* Are certain polys well known for certain courses (i.e. Business or Engineering) and if so, what are they?Thanks.",JAE 2011,5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f0sst/jae_2011/,,"|Don't consider Poly unless you really know what you want to do. It's a VERY competitive environment, and a common prerequisite to score well is to have interest in the course in the first place. Business &amp; Engineering are two very different things. If you're deciding between the both of them, I suggest you enter JC instead. I come from Poly, can't advise on JC stuff.|Man, I wish I could help you, but I took my 'O' levels 14 years ago, and when I entered ACJC the cutoff L1R5 for ACJC Science was 12 points. I don't think that's going to get you into ACJC Arts today (Arts cutoff was 17 points in my day).|I've heard good things about Nanyang JC. My advice would be to check what the consequences of appealing are (price, ability of grade to be lowered etc). If you do appeal, talk to your subject teacher for their advice and act accordingly. Just my opinion, although i'm not really sure how the local system works. |I hope this reaches you in time.JCs are equally as competitive as Polys. No matter what you do, you have to first have already considered if you want a university education in Singapore. Local unis require you to score 80++ out of the max of 90 for you to get into a ""good course"".Before you embark on your route to JC, http://forum.brightsparks.com.sg/showthread.php?t=4226I think it's important to first keep the end in mind. (refer to link above)You may not need to know how a JC works right now, but you should only go to a poly if you REALLY know what you see yourself doing in the future. Don't just apply to Aerospace Engineering or Hospitality just because your friends are doing it. Just saying.To answer your questions:1) 1 point off is as good as completely missing the mark, unless you have some guanxi to pull strings, you're better off with another school in your first choice.2) I personally come from Meridian JC, and as much as my experience was phenomenal, it boils down to preference. All JCs offer the same courses to varying degrees of effectiveness, you just gotta keep in mind: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. The amount of time less spent on travelling gives you more time to rest, play, and study. Especially in a JC where time is short.3) I am pretty sure of a few things: SP has great engin. courses, TP for their business, NP for mass comm. There may be differences in the others' opinions but that's what I've heard all the while. Some polys do not offer the same course that another would offer. So choose carefully if you do.TL;DR, pre-tertiary education is tough, want a quick route to the university? Choose JC. Wanna hit jobstreet asap? Go Poly. Whatever you do, make your time count.|I'm probably too late for this, but i'll try a shot in the dark. The most compelling reason choosing between JC and poly is really the consideration of an eventual tertiary education. Yes, both choices offer a route to the govt sponsored universities in Singapore, but that is based on the level of how far you're willing to work your ass off to secure your future in terms of acquiring the proper accolades and certificates. Consider the base difference between a JC and Poly. One offers an A'level certificate, whilst the other, a diploma. A'levels certs, to my knowledge, are almost close to useless when applying for jobs, as it is not recognised as a standard of expertise. Diplomas on the other hand, are useful in that aspect, and certifies you as a semi-professional in your area of studies.If you do not have a predilection towards diligence when it comes to academia, taking a JC route is a surefire way to screw your life up. The whole point of JC was to prepare you sufficiently for a tertiary education, and if that aim was not achieved, you would've wasted 2 years on a useless piece of paper. These 2 years could've been better used pursuing a diploma, which would've placed you at a better position when you're out looking for jobs. And mind you, this is just getting into tertiary education. The whole ballgame changes when we're talking into getting you into tertiary education, and INTO the course that you're willing to pursue. The hottest courses in local universities are in a state of constant competition. Bidding modules is the norm, and to make the most out of your 3-4 years in a tertiary education, having good results from your A'levels will go a long way. IF you decide the JC route, and managed to get into Uni, but NOT able to acquire the course that you are interested in, wouldn't that also have been a colossal waste of time? The worst case scenario is that you barely made the cutoff into tertiary education, and hence only had a limited number of courses to choose from, and all of them are those fringe outliers that hardly anybody take an interest in. Is that what you want?So, when you do make a choice eventually. Do yourself a favour, sit down, and decide your level of commitment to yourself. If you lack faith in your ability to persevere for the next 5-6 years of your education, getting a diploma would be a much safer bet. If you do excel in poly, there's always a chance you can enter university from there, taking only an extra year in the process.  If you are sincere about endeavoring for your future, then take on JC, as it's the quickest route to universities, to a degree, and to a position where you're armed with the proper accolades to better plan ahead for your future.Once all these are considered, the rest are secondary. Having the commitment to study will ensure that you will excel anywhere, so my recommendation is that you pick the nearest available JC/Poly. Evey other choice boils down to luck, what works for other people won't work the same way for you. Your friends in JC/Poly will determine the eventual experience, much more so than the academia. All in all, it can be the best years of your life, or it could be the worst, there's nothing you can do about it, at least, not right now. Hope this helps.**Edit:** (taking into account that tertiary level is a government sponsored university and not one of the multitude of foreign universities that's only affordable by the upper middle classes of Singapore)"
