"What's in our water? I've just recently started keeping a betta and have bought the API freshwater master test kit to be testing my parameters. Im puzzled af after my ammonia levels keep constantly showing up at 0.25ppm~0.5ppm and so i've decided to test treated, tank and tap water itself. All results turn up the same and i have no idea if its the fault of the master test kit or if its due to ammonia being found in the tap water itself anyway. I know that chloride and fluoride is purposefully added to our drinking water and that previously, there was some JB water thingy that resulted in ammonia being present in the water? Fish keepers and enthusiasts, do u keep ur fishes in tank water from our taps?"
"Whatever system we are living under perpetuates child abuse and neglect. Gonna be mostly a ranty post by a 16 year old cause I don't have much outlets, sorry if its incoherent.  We are all aware of how asian parents are, whatever is normal discipline can be treated as child abuse in other countries. I'm sure I went through a lot of the same shit other people in a traditional Chinese family did, a non-exhaustive list includes:* Withholding pocket money* Withholding food* Forced to sleep outside the house* Forced to stand outside the house for hours* Forced to kneel for hours* Caned till bleeding* Slapped non stop for bad grades, not doing homework* Verbal abuse (idiot, stupid, r\*tarded, down syndrome)These is what I treated as normal for most of my life, and as I grew older, obviously I realised a lot of this shouldn't be tolerated, but what could I do. Weirdly enough, most of these stopped as I grew older into sec school and its just been verbal abuse. These has mostly shaped who I am today, and has led to a lot of mental health issues on my part, and growing suicidal ideation, which has been in my head for most of my life, but I only started acting on it when I was 13.It was when I was 14 that I started refusing to accept the verbal abuse, and would argue back, I think parents would call this the ""rebellious"" phase, my mom would call me a gangster. Police would be called, and they would say its disciplinary. Even after multiple suicide attempts and trips to IMH, nothing was done about my mother (father is not in the picture due to divorce).When I was 15, my older sister (2 years older) came out as transgender to my mother, obviously this did not go well, every few weeks there would be arguments, I learned to protect my sister since she was always the good kid who never got punished while I was the bad one so she would not talk back. It's not like we are trying to start shit with my mother, she would just find things to get irritated at, get irrationally angry, and we have to call the police to stop and get some sleep. So that's how it's been for the past year or two, which brings me to the past 2 days.My sister is working and wears women's clothing at work. Yesterday by chance, my mother bumped into my sister and saw her in women's clothing, when my mother got home before my sister, she took away all her women's clothing, and hid it somewhere we still don't know. Obviously my sister got really angry when she came home, but my mother would not talk to us and had us call the police, which is something that happens a lot. She will not listen to what we have to say, no matter how calm we say it, she views it as us being 'gangster' and really dislikes when people disagree with her.But the biggest reason she gets us to call the police is cause the police won't change shit. They just take our statements, calm us down, ask for ic, phone number, the usual questions, and just tell us not to provoke her. Yesterday, the same shit happened with police but we were told to lodge a police report at the nearest neighbourhood center.This morning thats what we did, and after 2 hours, waiting for the police to deal with a case that came up midway, and we were told to go home, ask for the clothes back, go to family counseling, and call the police again if she gets confrontational.Coming back home in the afternoon after lunch, we immediately asked for the clothes back, she told us not to talk to her like that (another thing she does a lot when she doesn't like what we are saying), and of course, to call the police. Knowing that family counseling won't do much since she has never listened to us once in her life, we called the police again.Same shit happened, took statements, ic, phone number. However, this time the police told us there's not much choice other than to go to court. **They want a 16 and 18 year old, to go to court, against their mother, over fucking clothing.** I told them how ridiculous this was, and they said ""It's not like theres nothing we can do, but..."", plot twist there was nothing they could do.And thats where this ends for now, I still can't believe this is our only option, something that will take probably months and many hurdles, just because my mother is a transphobic pos. She thinks she can do anything to us cause she brought us up with money and food (something she willingly took away to punish me). These parents need to realise that when they bring a life into this world, it is their responsibility to provide them with money, housing and food, not treat us like a fucking investment. All this traditional family and filial piety shit can happily disappear with our generation.Edit: Thanks for all the helpful comments, I’ll look into the advice I’ve been given, just wanted to clarify a few things. I forgot to mention in this post that we are looking to move my sister out and remove my mother as her legal guardian, the police told us to ask HDB, but I was wondering about any other people’s experience with it.And yea the police said going to court is our only option and maybe getting PPO but they also said getting PPO over clothes is a bit finickyI’ll definitely be in contact with social workers to advice us what to do from now on"
"Why is it that physical Meet the People sessions (MPS) are still discontinued after a year but yet 50% must WFO? As title.The discontinuity in rules really bothers me. Cases are increasing, hence the recent speech by LW that [restrictions will remain](https://tdy.sg/3F082jQ) despite the arbitrary criteria of  the infection rate being below 1 for 2+ months, and that out of [2252 recorded omicron cases only 3 needed oxygen - and were taken off within 3 days.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/omicron-delta-covid-19-singapore-brace-bigger-wave-2416581)So it's not safe enough to resume anything more than 5pax meetups, but we can have 1k pax 'townhalls' and 50% in office.And yet, paradoxically, its not safe enough that physical MPS? Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is considered 'work', and if 1k pax events are safe, how would you logic this away?This rules for thee but not for mee is getting on my nerves"
"Been waiting for PEP approval for over 3 months. MOM officers tell me to keep waiting. Is there something I can do? Hi everyone!Long story short, I applied for PEP over 12 weeks ago. Starting week 9, I contacted the MOM a few times. They told me I will get the approval request result by the end of last week. I didn’t get it. When I contacted them again, they told me the relevant officer will get to me, but he never did. This happened multiple times.Has anyone been in this situation?Is there anything I can do in order to check what is going on?Can I physically go to the MOM?"
Why isn't smoking while walking banned? For non smokers.. It is really very irritating when we are walking behind them. I really hope NEA can pass a law about this.
Anyone else been smelling haze since yesterday? I live in the east and it's been particularly bad since last evening. The burning smells is very strong despite the 24 hr PSI listing it as merely moderate. Anyone else experiencing the same?
"For those that want tips on how to cope with depression or want to know what Singapore's mental healthcare system is like Hey all. 20M Singaporean here, have been coping with depression for the past 3 years. Here are some ways that helped me cope. I will just get straight to the tips, if you are interested in my back story or want to know the process of getting referred to IMH to read on.If you don't want to read this, here's the most important part. **You can only rely on yourself.**Tip 1: Don't rely on friends.Don't get me wrong, you can talk to your friends about your troubles and spend time with them to distract yourself. At the end of the day, you can only help yourself. They will not be there for you forever and friends come and go. They wouldn't want to keep someone who always talks about negative things around them.Tip 2: Listen to music.I'm sure we've all done this; lying down on your bed, staring at your ceiling and overthinking. Play some music. Just be sure not to play any music that's associated with bad memories. Finding new songs or genres of music really lifts your mood and gets your mind off the painful thoughts.Tip 3: Learn an instrument.I know this isn't for everyone but learning a new instrument can help pass time. Seeing your effort come to fruition is really satisfying and honestly makes you feel a lot better.Tip 4: Play with your pets.I'm sure there are some scientific studies that show that playing with your pets can help improve your mood. I didn't really look it up but personally it really helped.Tip 5: Take walks or just relax outdoors alone.Going out to the beach or somewhere quiet is really refreshing, especially after spending all that time cooped up in your room. You can bring your instrument along as well :).Tip 6: Talk to your parents.I know this may not be an option for everyone out there, but if you are lucky to have this as an option then please do so. Some parents may not understand what you are going through, but at least you're not bottling up everything. If you can't talk to your parents, try finding a psychologist (which is pretty hard here in Sg).Tip 7: Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.Having a drink now and then and crying really helps. But don't overdo it on the drinking, you'll only develop dependence, and same goes for the drugs (obviously).For those that are lucky enough to have not experienced depression, this is what it's like. Everyday waking up seems like a chore. You don't have motivation to do the simplest things like washing up or eating. You just want to lay in bed and close your eyes. You don't look forward to anything, not even your hobbies or playing games. You just don't have to will to do anything. You lose appetite, you want less human interaction and you just feel like fucking shit. I'm writing this to help those of you out there that feel the same way.Okay, now that I have laid out the groundwork for what I'm going to say, here is how I've learnt these tips. If you were just here for the tips you don't have to read on, but if you are interested on how the mental healthcare scene is in Singapore I will touch on that.I'm going to make this short, so I don't catch myself ruminating about my bad times. I was left out and bullied in secondary school leading to super low self-esteem. Was never invited to birthday parties or anything of the sort, not even hangouts at the nearby mall. I was lucky enough to be oblivious to how I was being treated by my ""friends"" though, so I don't think this played a huge part in my circumstance.Entered polytechnic, found my first actual group of friends and a girlfriend. We broke up shortly after getting together, later found out that she cheated on me with her ex. Being young and immature I started spiraling downwards into depression, drinking everyday, self harming etc. Lost interest in everything, basketball, studies, going out with friends, everything... Now that I look back it was really stupid of me. Almost jumped off a 25-storey building, later found out that my ex and her bf were making fun of me on social media for doing so. Fast forward about half a year later, found a new girlfriend and felt a lot better. My group of friends started falling apart because of small little arguments, only hung out with one or two friends. When I saw that the relationship was failing, started getting depressed and doing the same stupid things minus the suicide part. And to top it off, I fell out with my only friends in poly. Soon after, I broke up with my gf. I had no friends, no girlfriend. I decided to apply for deferment, which in my case was around 4 months or 1 semester. I went to see the doctor to get referred to IMH for depression. I'll touch on this part later, it's pretty important and i'm sure some of you are wondering what it would be like to be referred to IMH.During my deferment I thought it was a good idea to reconnect with my old secondary school friends. Everything was cool for the first month or so until they started to drift. I saw them as a distraction and it worked well while it lasted. Nobody really cared about how I just broke up or how I was feeling down 24/7. Soon after, I made some friends who were honestly of bad influence, started taking drugs and the sorts. After I cut everybody off, I went back to school, alone. As a retainee, nobody talked to me, I just went to school, sat through lessons and went home. It's pretty sad but I was fine with it.Here is where I tell you what I've learnt. Friends are a great distraction and nothing else. You can't rely on them, you can only rely on yourself. Sure, you can tell them about your problems, cry to them or spend time together. But at the end of the day, **you really have to reflect on yourself and stop moping around.** They have their own lives too, and they can't always be there when you need someone even though you were there for them when they did. Whenever any one of my friends was feeling down, I would drive over to their place and give them company. I did this countless times. But when I really needed somebody, no matter who I called, nobody would pick up. Nobody would care that I was feeling down. I don't blame them, I just wish that I cared about myself more. Now I wonder why I spent so much time and effort caring about others when really I should've been taking care of myself, though it would've been nice if they reciprocated. Don't get me wrong, you can cry and talk to your friends as much as your want, but don't expect anyone to be there for you when you really need someone, even for those who claim that they care. Friends come and go, that's just how it is.After realizing this I decided to cut contact with everyone, except those that were still worth talking to.Yes, it is lonely. Very lonely. Most of the time I would wake up with no notifications on my phone, no one talking to me, no one asking if I wanted dinner that night. I don't even have friends to play games with. But I've been caring for myself, making sure that I'm setting myself up for the future, when I actually enter adulthood.One more thing. Sure, you can smoke or drink, but do so in regulation. Trust me, if you drink yourself to sleep every night, your depression will still be there when you wake up.I abused K2 and weed because I had no one to spend time with. I had no friends, so I would go out alone and take drugs to relax and enjoy my alone time. Luckily for me, I didn't take anything more serious and it was just a phase. Once I stopped taking them and faced my problems straight up, I didn't want to go back to taking them. Although it does help you relax and get rid of your problems, it's only temporary. And it could lead to drug addiction. Nobody wants that.Okay here's the more interesting part. Singapore's mental healthcare. Here is what I did to get referred to IMH. I may not remember everything in detail. I went to a private clinic and told him I was showing symptoms of depression. He would write a letter and then you would go to a polyclinic to have a psychiatrist have a look at you. If they think that you should be admitted to IMH, then they would write another letter and you would have to take it there. This process takes around 3-4 months. If I remember correctly, you have to go for multiple assessments. Meaning that they would ask you the same questions as: ""How is your mood? How is your appetite? Have you lost interest in your hobbies?""The sad thing is that these psychiatrists aren't there to listen to your problems and give you advice. They are just there to assess you. Once you go through the multiple assessments, they will schedule an appointment for you at IMH. The waiting time is at least 1-2 months. During your first appointment, the doctor has access to the information that they collected from the assessments, and they will prescribe antidepressants. You have to return every 7 weeks (I think?) to refill your medication. And yes you have to pay, I was on 3 different types of medication at one point, each visit would cost me about $200. The sad thing is that throughout this entire process, unless you see a private psychologist costs $300+ per session, they will only refer you to one after your first appointment at IMH. And then you have to wait at least another month or two for your appointment. So throughout this entire 6 month-ish process, they only assess you and give you medicine. In other words, they just do their job. There is no therapy whatsoever. I didn't bother to go for the psychologist appointments because they just took so long.And here is another story to top it off. There was a period of time, quite recently in fact, where I was really down in the dumps and felt like I was going to do something stupid (off myself), so I drove to IMH A&amp;E to talk to a doctor or something. I understand that there are people out there with schizophrenia or more serious mental problems, but when I went there and told the front counter that I was afraid that I was going to do something dumb, I had to wait at least 3 hours before being able to see a doctor. You had to wait at the waiting area for 3 hours. I just took more drugs lol. Not even IMH A&amp;E can help you, unless you are willing to wait 3 hours or more, but if you're suicidal I don't think you would wait 3 hours.I've stopped taking the medication for about a week now. I do not have friends to rely on, I only have myself. I know hearing me saying you can only rely on yourself is sickening but trust me, take care of yourself. The only people that will take care of you are your parents or your maybe your significant other. Not even IMH cares.If you have any questions do leave them in the comments :).Edit:Thank you all for the comments and suggestions. Please remember that you are not alone, you can always feel free to rant in the comments :D"
"Legal basis for rent reduction due to poor quality? We're a bunch of exchange students who rent out a condo to live in. When we arrived, the whole apartment wasn't cleaned, the fridge wasn't even emptied. The contractually agreed upon kitchen utensils did not exist. The washing machine and dryer were broken to the point they were unusable. There's mold all over the bathrooms and ants coming out of the bathroom door. We couldn't use half the condo's facilities because the access card application is so long drawn out and unnecessarily complicated. The landlady and agent have been rather unresponsive and unfriendly throughout the whole process. And to top it all off, all three elevators were broken for a while a few days ago.We did get them to send a cleaner after one of our mate's SHN finished, but there's still mold and a lot of fat and grease up in the extractor hood to the point this might constitute a fire hazard. We went to IKEA and bought kitchen utensils that we'll subtract from the rent with the landlady's agreement.Still, we did not get what we paid for at all during the first two weeks of our contract. Yes we had a guy in quarantine, but all of the matters should have been fixed before we moved in. Ants are still there and so is the mold. I tried searching online if we have a case to simply pay less rent, sort of a forceful rent reduction. I know it is a thing in Germany and France, but during my research I found pretty much nothing on tenant protection here, I guess there aren't a lot of people who rent. What I did find is that it's a thing in Australia as well, so I'm assuming this sort of legal basis exists in the English legal system, which I assume the Singaporean one is based upon. But as you can see that's a lot of assumptions and not a lot of knowledge.We would appreciate it a lot if someone could share their knowledge on this topic and help us out.Do let me know if this is the wrong place to post / ask. I thought it's more than a quick question for the weekly thread, so I'm making it its own posts, I hope this works."

"Why does conscription in Singapore last so long? Singapore is has one of the longest conscriptions in the world, even longer than countries actively threatened by its neighbours. For comparison:Israel: [30 months active service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel) active service. Reservists can be called up but are virtually not in any year unless there is a crisis.Military Situation: Israel's political situation is always tense and violent. Neighbouring countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran do not recognise it as a legitimate state. Since its creation Israel in 1948 has fought eight major wars, many smaller uprisings and low-level insurgencies in the Middle East. Israel is routinely attacked by insurgents through bombings, artillery and guerilla fighters and deploys its military beyond its borders to fight these insurgents.South Korea: [Up to 21 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea) active service. Reservists may be called up for up to 4 years on the Mobilization Reserve and up to 8 on the Homeland Reserve.Military Situation: South Korea is in a de facto state of war with North Korea, a nuclear armed rogue state under an absolute dictaroship with a million man active army. It has fought one major war, the Korean war, where North Korea invaded it to try and seize control. Since then several rare skirmishes at the DMZ have occurred. North Korea routinely threatens to invade and even use nuclear missiles.Taiwan: [Officially abolished in 2018, but Taiwanese males still serve 4 months of conscription.](https://thediplomat.com/2019/08/taiwans-all-volunteer-force-transition-still-a-challenge/)Military Situation: Taiwan is considered a rogue province by mainland China. It has fought in the Chinese Civil War which ended in 1949 and three Strait crisis between it and China. China plans to one day reunify Taiwan and [has never ruled out using military force to do so.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58854081) Chinese airplanes enter Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone daily. The CCP also heavily punishes any country recognising Taiwan in any way, including an famous visit by Lee Hsien Long to Taiwan which China raised a furor at.Singapore: 22-24 months, plus approximately six months call up reservist. Can be called up up till the age of 40 for non-officers and 50 for officers.Military Situation: Since independence Singapore has had one low-level conflict with Indonesia during Konfrontasi which ended in 1965 when Indonesian President Sukarno was deposed in a coup by the Indonesian military. Konfrontasi ended just one month after Singapore became independent. Singapore maintains friendly relations with all its neighbors including free trade, diplomatic visits and joint military exchanges. The tensest time in Singapore's history would be during the 1991 National Day Parade, when Malaysia and Indonesia conducted a paratrooper exercise with 300 paratroopers 20km from the border.Why is Singapore special? Our total service period is approximately 30 months which is as high as Israel and much higher than Taiwan/South Korea. Yet we are in much less danger.  EDIT: A lot of good arguments from both sides, but what we all seem to agree on is that minimally NSFs should be paid more to recognise their contribution and to partially offset the lost income suffered, especially for NSFs from working class families who need it the most. If civil servant pay all pegged to private industry, so why not do the same for NSF? Use a basic $10/hr full time salary in private industry as a basis. Eight hours a day, five days a week for fifty two weeks a year. That's a 1.7k basic pay a month for NSF."

"Why does no one talk about the lack of diversity in Singapore's Public Service's top management? When we look at the composition of Singapore's ministers, there seems to be a fair amount of diversity both in terms of gender (although this could be improved) and ethnicities. It seems *somewhat* representative of the actual population. We have Tharman, Dr. Vivian, Shanmugam, Iswaran, Masagos, Indranee, Dr. Maliki who are all from minority communities and part of the cabinet.But when we look at the senior management of the public service, this balance seems to completely disappear. I did a quick search and the only article with a full list of Permanent Secretaries was from 2018.http://www.visakanv.com/sg/permsecs/Every PS here appears to be Chinese. I did a quick search of the senior management of different ministries in the government directory and even now all Permanent Secretaries and the vast majority of Deputy Secretaries are Chinese. This is public information so this is not a conspiracy theory or anything, anyone can look up this information.What's driving this rather major lack of representation in our public service groups and why isn't this more talked about or discussed?If meritocracy is seen as a reason, then how are we able to form cabinets that are sufficiently diverse but not the public service senior management. Also, I wonder if anything is being done to address this issue (if it is even seen as an issue)."
"Some clinics don't do PCR anymore? I don't know if it's recent protocol changes, but a family clinic I went to did not carry out PCR test after I had consulted the doctor for flu symptoms. They only conducted ART (Covid-19 Ag) and I got the results like half an hour later through sms.The doctor said 'Now govt say no need do PCR' and I was a tad bit skeptical seeing how many people got negative through ART and positive through PCR. Any thoughts?"

"What do you think is going to happen to all the HDB flats when the 99-years are up? The en-bloc option is only given to a select few blocks mainly due to being in prime location. Also, the number of flats built increased exponentially after 1970s, so theorectically speaking, there would be entire huge batches of flats with leases expiring at the same time."
"Singaporeans are paying more for petrol than they have ever paid in our nation's history Petrol prices are rising all around the world and prices at the pump in Singapore are rising too. As of 4th February, SPC's Levo 92 costs S$2.67/litre, which is the highest it has ever been in our nation's history. Historically, petrol prices have tended to front-run the price of crude oil when crude prices increase from a low base, which was the case last year. Oil prices have not yet even exceeded their previous highs made in 2014, yet petrol prices have already exceeded those levels!  https://preview.redd.it/9d42vxonm7g81.png?width=1460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cccd13f61928b654f3838c67c61da096ab76492"
"Why do Singaporeans not insist on better bike infrastructure? I know... I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity &amp; the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people.  Bear with me 1 sec.   Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun &amp; healthy.  Climate, gradient &amp; size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation.  If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you.  Rain just cools you more!  I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry &amp; clean up.Only problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful.  Regulations &amp; design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right.  The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs &amp; trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.Today I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub.  First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail.  Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise).  There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why?? Second photo shows an inaccurate Google Maps which made me think I could easily cross Merdeka Bridge to get to Sports Hub - I encountered multiple staircases to cross the bridge, barrier walls preventing me from getting to the PCN by the river, and eventually found the only real connection was to take an unmarked crossing across the high-speed entrance to Stadium Rd, where the median isn't even wide enough to safely pause with a cycle. No directional / informational signs anywhere.Serious question - I don't mean to bash Singapore.  I certainly understand as the city has evolved, there would be some poorly planned older infrastructure.  But why does the population accept such poorly designed NEW stuff?  Cycling is historically not a rich man's hobby - it's a means of movement, health &amp; access for the masses. I just struggle to understand why people have tolerated this ongoing prioritization of cars in Singapore.  Is there an advocacy group here that works with the government to increase equitable access to public spaces during infrastructure planning decisions?Thank youEDIT: Thank you everyone for the largely supportive and civil discussion! Really lifted my spirits and gives me hope for the future of Singapore because I had the wrong impression that no one else cared about this. Apologies that I couldn't keep up with all the comments as I had a lot of work to do.  Regarding the weather.. Singapore simply is not THAT hot.  Mean temp is &lt;28C and it doesn't fluctuate much. Compared to Dubai or South India, or summers in Europe or Americas or Australia, it's really not hot at all.  Sunshine is not dangerous - it's actually really good for you!  See [https://youtu.be/2Zzo4SJopcY](https://youtu.be/2Zzo4SJopcY) Singapore has no typhoons (very rarely), hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, sleet or ice.  There is a reason a person can bike 4x as far as they can walk: it's EASIER.  So less effort, less sweat, plus more breeze to cool down.  Just a fact. OK, it's hot, but it's not the hottest place in the world - it's totally within functional range (IMHO)https://preview.redd.it/8ez1i2ik1eg81.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcdcbba5911136248fe8f464e9cc16bd392b7dd3https://preview.redd.it/nel707ik1eg81.jpg?width=434&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e80f5bb97455a54f0bc74fea3c93ecefd351009"

Is it true that Town council allows people to use their personal/own full size incense bins freely at HDB common areas instead of strictly only using designated incense bins at designated burning areas? Meaning a family can choose to bring their own full-size incense bin to the 1st floor common area of another HDB block far away from their own HDB block so that their own homes won't have the smell of burnt fumes? So for example if 10 families do it at the same time at another block...is it considerable for a fire hazard or should wait till something happens first? (Also I don't understand the logic of bringing one's own incense bin to burn at another HDB block because you don't want your own burnt fumes to smoke up your own home🧐?)

"Availability of Paxlovid in Singapore I am pretty young and have also been boosted. It is unlikely that I will need to take this antiviral medication. However, I have an 87-year-old grandmother at home who has severe lung complications. In the unfortunate but increasingly likely event that she gets covid, I would think that antiviral medication, such as the newly approved Paxlovid (a shipment of which arrived in Singapore approximately a week ago), would be appropriate. I am wondering if GPs prescribe any antiviral medications for higher-risk individuals infected with covid? Also, I would like to know if the new Paxlovid drug is available at GP clinics island-wide or can it only be found at hospitals? Thanks!"

"Tracetogether revisited Wanted to give some thoughts after reading this article: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451)Unpacking some of the points in this article:\- "" Measures for contact tracing, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, will continue until Singapore authorities "" - 1) Is contact tracing still done and possible?. At the number of cases today its is highly unlikely that contact tracing is possible or even relevant. 2) many people do not report their ART positive status officially undermining contact tracing to be even possible; lets say for discussion sake that only half the people reports their Covid status, that means we have about 40k cases per day. Let say that each of them had contact with 20 people during their contagious phase. This would imply 800k people per day would be subject to ""contract tracing"" or about 14% of the population per day!; and 3) As per the same government rules one just need to sit it out at home when testing positive and can come out after 7 days in any case. **The rules literally imply no contact tracing to be required,** unless you wish to get you result registered, which is likely driven by the asymmetric advantages that you get for travel or to avoid a future booster.: ""If you are ART positive: 🏠 Recover from home. ➡️ No need to see a GP/polyclinic, if well/have mild symptoms. ➡️ To register your results with MOH, visit a test centre ""\-  ""We need to wait until we no longer need vaccine-differentiated measures"" - 1) what about MRTs, buses, they are not vaccine-differentiated, people just hop on and off. And keeping 1 meter distance in MRTs of buses is impossible. - so lets agree that the country is not really in a in a complete vaccine-differentiated state; 2) how many people are really non-vaccinated, there are around 2-4% of 60+ people non vaccinated. (source: [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/statistics](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/statistics)) Shall we let an entire country get organised around these few that had 1.5+ year to get vaccinated and at this point are either completely complacent and irrelevant in a democratic thinking or might have underlying complications that refrain them from vaccination which would be a status quo in any other scenarios anyways. 3) kids under 12y are not getting sick. Only 0.013% of cases under 12y has ever been to ICU. (source: [https://data.gov.sg/dataset/covid-19-vaccination?view\_id=f79f003d-17e3-4e46-857e-f9959b149ba3&amp;resource\_id=fd882470-fc1c-45ce-8aec-e4c1c898f80c](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/covid-19-vaccination?view_id=f79f003d-17e3-4e46-857e-f9959b149ba3&amp;resource_id=fd882470-fc1c-45ce-8aec-e4c1c898f80c) )\-"" enable authorities to issue health risk warnings and notices quickly "" - 1) why would health risk warnings still be a thing if people are not required to declared their covid positive status? So health warnings are just done in case somebody decides to declare their status for the above mentioned reasons? So just rather randomThe comparison of tracetogether with seat belts is a statistical joke. Lets compare the mortality rate of today's Covid with the mortality changes one get in a car accident. If we make cars illegal, there wont be any car accidents either.I also see more and more places getting these automated Tracetogether gates, which mean money is spent and we are doubling down on access restriction. rant out"
"It's impossible to cancel your Singtel account and this practice is regressive and illegal in most western countries. I have been trying to get Singtel support on phone and it's impossible to cancel services. Here's the rub: * Takes 30 mins to reach a human * When I finally reached a customer support agent, he said I need to call yet another number* That number doesn't exist* Call the agent back * Wait 30 mins* Agent says ""they will whatsapp me""* Wait few hours - no whatsapp * call back * Nobody picks this time * give up * call back next day * Rinse, repeat. I am surprised Singtel is so brazen about this. In US it would probably be a FTC complain that I can file online. I'm not sure if IMDA responds to such complaints here though."
"Should euthanasia be legalised? Assisted dying is legal in New Zealand. Singapore has many aging elderly whom may have reached their end of life goal. My father, who's now alone without any siblings alive, he has no desire to live. He does not have anything to look forward to in life.Should euthanasia be legal? Would it help our aging society? Would it help to lessen the pain of those ill for the remaining of their lives? I do think it would help some people out."
"Strange scam involving leaked data (?) My legal name has the format [Surname] [Chinese name], [Western name]. This will be important. Yesterday afternoon I received a call from a +65 number. Knowing that it's a scam, I picked it up anyway to be greeted by a human speaking Mandarin, claiming to be from MOH, who addressed me using the format [Surname] [Chinese name]. This was especially interesting considering a few factors: government officials typically speak English and would address me by [Western name] [Surname], no one addresses me by my Chinese name because they **will** get it wrong the first try, and the scammer used my dialect surname instead of using the Mandarin reading of my surname. For this reason I use my Chinese name as a shibboleth because it is so difficult even actual Chinese native speakers might get it wrong the first try, meaning that friends no matter where they are from will always try to use my Western name. Even online my name formats are either [Western name] [Surname] or [Surname] [Chinese name] (,) [Western name]. So I went on the offensive by pointedly asking it ""What is my full name then?"" in Mandarin, but it kept dodging the question. After a lot of persuasion I managed to get my name spelt out *but without the Western name*. I kept telling it that the name is still incomplete and kept putting on the pressure to spell out my full name, because [Surname] [Chinese name] alone is not my full name. The scammer kept dodging the question until it lost patience and asked me if I wanted to hear it say my IC number, which made it even more intriguing. After accepting the challenge, the scammer said an IC number that actually got everything correct *except for one number*. And it's a number that would indicate which year I was born in. Now here's the question: assuming the IC number is actually scraped correctly but recited wrongly (the wrong number would have been invalid due to the wrong checksum anyway), how did they get only my Chinese name, yet not get my surname in Mandarin correct (meaning they did not get my name in hanzi). There's so much wrong with this scammer and I have to know where the data leak was coming from."
"Worrying number of slashing cases recently. Anyone genuinely worried by the recent cases? I don't think I've ever felt like this in quite a long time, or ever, actually.

Don't want to be on hyper alert just for being outdoors.     What are your thoughts regarding this? Am I just a pussy for even thinking this way?"
So many fights once restrictions lifted I’ve been out with my friends and accompanying them as they drink their beers. One thing I’ve realised is that people are back to fighting and arguing once the alcohol ban is lifted. Are drunkards that stupid? I’ve been out 4 times with my buddies and half of the time I’ve seen random guys already acting like idiots and nearly causing a scene. It’s like lifting restrictions brought the lousy drinkers back in full force.

"Why does salary not increase with inflation? This seems like common sense and should have been implemented globally a long long time ago. Why aren't there laws requiring employers to do so?

"Migrant workers are humans too. Please talk to them and support them Edit: I hope my post doesn’t come off as condescending or virtue signalling - it is genuinely meant to increase awareness of the plight of migrant workers and small things we can do to make it better for them. Apologies if you felt that way, but that is definitely not my intention!I am not sure if my post is going to gain much traction or if people here are going to be sympathetic. But this is my story.I started volunteering adhoc at ItsRainingRaincoats earlier this year, and came across so many migrant workers living in not-so-great conditions and going through a lot of mental anguish that you and I don’t have to face on a daily basis. Almost all of them pay hefty contract fees to agents in their home countries to come and work here, making peanuts every month. They need to pay back the agent fees while supporting their families. They get no subsidies on transport, food and daily expenses - a lot of them pay the same price as you and me for daily items like eggs, rice, etc. They get only one day of leave per month and frankly, the work they do is unsafe and backbreaking. Having not seen their family and other loved ones for 2+ years, they’re not in the best state of mind right now. The least we can do, as Singapore residents, is to talk to them as fellow humans. I’m not saying that you need to go out of your way to get them food, snacks or do favours for them - but just talk to them as a friend would. Find out more about their day. Ask them how they are. Treat them as an equal - all of us are in this country to make a better life for ourselves, whether we were born here or chose to live here. Today, I interacted with a migrant worker who’s painting our condo walls. It was just general chitchat, where I asked him about his work and family situation and how he breaks his fast everyday. He told me that I was the first one to interact with him (mind you, they’ve been working here for close to 1.5 months). I felt immensely guilty and ashamed - that I’d not done spoken to him sooner, and that other people haven’t spoken to him either. They paint the walls daily in harsh sunlight, getting no break in between.We all have our own biases - but this is my plea to go break them and look beyond them. E.g. a lot of people on this sub believe that they need to work harder so that BTO flats are ready on time, but that’s really not their fault and it’s silly to blame them in my opinion.Thanks if you read till here!"
"Peanut Allergy sufferers in Singapore Hi all. I’m sure it has been asked before but I was hoping there might be some more up to date information or wisdom that can be shared.This summer I will be going to Singapore as part of my university course for 6 weeks or so. However I suffer from a peanut allergy (and pine nuts as well, although it’s the peanuts that concern me here) and I have heard that peanuts and peanut oil in particular are prevalent in most Singaporean cuisine. The plus sides are that I am fairly proficient in Putonghua and would be confident conversing with hawker stall cooks/restaurant waiters etc, and my peanut allergy is not so serious that I cannot even be near nuts. I do not usually carry an epipen in my home country either, although I do have some anyway.I was wondering if any of you have any suggestions on the best places/stalls/restaurants in Singapore to go to for peanut free food? And even better, if there are any dishes which rarely if ever contain peanuts or peanut oil? Thanks in advance for your help!"

"Should the government start investing in centralised cooling for all new BTO projects? &gt;*Edit: Looking at some of the comments, many don't know what a centralized cooling system entails. I'd recommend you to* [*read this website*](https://www.mytengah.sg/centralised-cooling/) *about the upcoming Tengah BTO estate project with a centralised cooling system to understand more. Central system does not mean everyone has to pay the same amount, or suffer under the same temperature. A centralised cooling system should (under ideal circumstances) not result in an extreme difference in home prices (the government should use taxpayers monies to research and build infrastructure for this). In fact, this system uses water cooling which is way more efficient than conventional aircon compressors (if we want to have any chance at seeing Singapore with &lt;40 degrees C temperature in the next 50 years due to the urban heat effect).*Looking at how unsustainable our climate issues have become, shouldn’t the government be investing more into infrastructure (edit: and/or research) for centralised cooling systems in all new BTOs?I know it’s not that simple and it involves costs (edit: and many other considerations as well). But I’d rather have my taxpayers monies going into this rather than funding holidays for our dear SDAs or covid bailouts for greedy retail landlords."

I already explained myself in the comments below.&amp;#x200B;So I recently graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in Media &amp; Communication and I'm a Burmese national. When I was on Student Pass, I worked a few jobs with ease, part-time then full-time until the expiration of my pass. Now I have applied to more jobs and went to interviews that went really well until I see the interviewer's face drop when I told them I need a Work Pass. Instant no.The obstacle is...well, very inescapable and I'm constantly disappointed at the fact I may have gotten a job if it wasn't for my foreigner status. Not gonna cry about it, obviously, there will be a local preference and I don't do anything that's high in demand. And often the companies I apply to have no foreigner quota.I come here to ask for advice. What do I do? I cannot go home to Myanmar. I don't have the option. There is no possible way to advance a career there at the current state, let alone find a job. I had the option of going to university in the UK until I decided over 20,000 pounds a year was way too much for a path I wasn't even terribly excited about. My goal is to literally just support myself in Singapore, to pay for rent, food, survive, yanno?Is there anyone on the same boat? Would appreciate any advice. I keep on applying to jobs, aiming for bigger companies but there isn't a lot I qualify for although I think I have a decent portfolio and amount of experience. Thanks everyone."

"Medical test coverage for FDW I have an FDW friend whose been working in Singapore for a few years. She has a lump in her breast and a history of breast cancer in her family. After much deliberation she went to NUH and got an ultrasound scan. She paid from her own pocket for this. Now she’s been asked to do a biopsy, I believe they told her the cost is between 1200-1700. She doesn’t have that kind of money on her and her insurance only covers costs if hospitalised. Her employer(a single mother) flat out refused to help her saying lumps in breasts are normal, and she herself has one, so there’s nothing to worry. She will check with NUH if they can admit her for a day so she can claim insurance. Other than that are there any other avenues open to her to seek financial support?"

"Urgent help: Friends detained at JB because customs officers didn't stamp their passports Would really appreciate everyone's advice on what to do.For context, I went with a group of friends on a short 3D2N trip to JB. Most of our friend group went on Friday morning by bus, but 2 friends rented a car and joined later that evening. These 2 friends cleared the Woodlands checkpoint but ran into some issues with their Touch n Go card at the JB checkpoint (it was their first time travelling into Malaysia by car). The officer held onto their passports and directed them to sort it out at some kind of toll office, and when they finished up and came back, they didn't check whether their passports were stamped. While they obviously should have checked, I believe that this genuinely slipped their mind amidst the chaos and confusion.Earlier today we were returning to SG in the same rented car. The officers noticed that 2 passports lacked a stamp and took us for questioning. Imo, they were very hostile and intimidating -  for example one of them would walk over to a wooden board where they had printed out and pinned the relevant statute stipulating the maximum penalties etc, and made a big show of reading it. They also pulled one of us (who was a Malaysian aside) and kept communicating in Malay while not really explaining the situation to the rest of us, and repeatedly emphasized the gravity of the offence, the 14 day maximum detention period etc. They seemed very insistent on detaining my friends, even though my friends tried very hard to explain their case and even offered proof of entry via the causeway on their driver's app etc.So currently, my 2 friends are being detained there and are uncontactable. The rest of us headed back to SG via bus and have notified their family and friends. We've tried calling a few lines eg the High Commission but this all happened after office hours so we couldn't get a hold of most of them.I'm worried sick for my friends especially as I'm unfamiliar with the conditions of the detention center and how they're being treated. Would really appreciate advice/sharings by anyone who's encountered similar situations.&amp;#x200B;UPDATE: They are safely back in SG! Will update with more details soon if they allow us to"

Such that even if they repeal, we may end up worse than before if their form of compromise is to replace a non-enforced law with enforced discrimination, or even use the repeal to argue against the existence of that discrimination.EDIT: if you disagree, please specify why instead of just downvoting, because I’m definitely hoping I’m wrong on this."

The distance is not too long and majority of Malaysia's population live in the Malay Peninsula and Malaysia itself is a medium income country, so there is literally no reason for this high speed rail line to not exist."

"Is anyone else disheartened as a result of the latest discussion on S377A? I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest. Just look at MHA’s statement in this article: ‘MHA added: ""Everyone, including religious groups, is entitled to their views on different matters, including on LGBT issues, and to express their views, so long as they do not denigrate any groups of persons, and do not break any laws.""’ https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/town-hall-urges-against-repealing-section-377a-without-safeguards-for-marriage-familiesBut look at what these religious groups are saying in the very same article:‘Mr Wong and Mr Khair wrote: ""Youths, parents, workers and more decided that it was #timetoact to protect family, marriage, our freedom of conscience, and most importantly our children, who are at the heart of these social institutions.""They added: ""We've been relatively restrained in the face of an intolerant, vocal minority that seeks to overturn the order in all areas of society - be it marriage, education, businesses, or beliefs, while demonising all those who disagree as 'bigots' or 'haters', instead of engaging us with good faith. We will be silent no more.""’There’s a lot implied in the above. But more than anything, the part that really hurts my heart is “protect… our children”. Aren’t these groups are saying that they have to protect their kids from the LGBT community? Isn’t that the denigration that the govt warned against? What do you guys think?"
Forum: Religious beliefs should not dictate laws relating to LGBTQ matters Personal opinion: I'm not sure why the average Singaporean isn't concerned about the slow but steady encorchment of secular spaces by organized religions. Whether that is with regards to LGBTQ issues or otherwise is moot.

"Harrassed on MRT? Um, I think I was just harrassed on the MRT train??I was taking a Downtown Line train that was heading towards Bukit Panjang when I was suddenly approached by a man who asked me to take a photo of myself and send it to him on WhatsApp. I literally had no idea who this man was and why he wanted my photo so I asked him why he wanted my photo. He kept replying with the same answer that he ""just wanted my photo"" and kept insisting that I send the photo to him on WhatsApp. Obviously I was weirded out and refused to comply. When the train reached the next station, I just quickly made up an excuse that I had to alight at that station and bolted out of the train door. As I was alighting, I think the guy tried to grab my school bag but lost his grip. By the time I had reached the escalator I saw that he had retreated back into the train and was no longer pursuing me. I immediately went to the passenger service counter to lodge a report but they said there was nothing much they could do unless if I file a police report.Should I report this to the police or do I let it go? Cause I'm not sure if this counts as harrassment and I don't want to burden the police if this incident doesn't warrant a police investigation."
"Harrassed on MRT Part 2 Today I was going to work as usual. During the transit, I was scrolling Reddit and came across this post, that a man was asking the OP to take a photo and whatsapp him. Immediately my first thought is that OP might be a girl and I was thinking 'walau, why Singapore become like this liao?'6.30 PM I was going back home as usual. The same train that the aforementioned OP took, from Downtown to BP. I walked and took the escalator going up. In the midst of it, a slim and small guy (I am 173) wearing specs with black shirt and pants, in his 25-28 I believe, talked to me. As I was wearing earpiece, I coudln't understand what he was talking. Lazy me didnt turn off the music, I just keep 'huh' 'huh'. Turned out he was asking me to take selfie and whatsapp to him. I think he asked like 'Can you take a photo and whatsapp to me?' Suddenly my brain got an electric shock, shag, it was the Reddit post that I read this morning! But seriously dude, I am a guy also WTF. Then I straight away said no of course. That black shirt spec guy was very angry and show me his middle finger while walking up the escalator. Also at the same time, he kept on swearing. Everyone around was looking at him, but siao lang doesn't care one ma. I followed him from a distance, he rushed to take the bus that just arrived. The BP bus stop on the right-hand side once you come up the escalator, with Hillion on the left.I didnt feel angry, just feel sibeh strange. Why Singapore like this liao and why BP suddenly become Yishun huh? Anyway I am not planning to lodge any report, I dont feel any threat but only  strangeness."

"Bring back the Wolbachia (to my area) Reading up on the NEA website, I’m surprised my area is not one of the listed sites (Kallang/Geylang). However, I do seem to remember the male Wolbachia laced mosquito release in my neighbourhood last year.   I can attest that the mosquito population plummeted to such an extent that I’ve happily forgotten about the annoying red welts and nails scratching up arms and legs, for the last year+ , and now have seen the return of the dreaded buzzzzzzz and suspense thriller background music when I can’t hear or see the mosquito.  While my opinion is super positive - what do you think about the Wolbachia experiment and your experience pre/post the release in your area?

"Strange man coming to my HDB apartment So since the start of last month, my neighbors and my family noticed a stench of urine from the drain at our corridor. Once there was a big plop of shit just lying at the side of the corridor. Lately, we noticed a strange man wearing a black mask, dark blue hoodie, loitering at our doors. When we open the door, he would run away and dart into the stairwell. This usually occurs at night, sometimes even close to midnight. It's scaring us, given that my neighbors have children.I understand that HDBs are public housing and do not have security guards, so the corridors are counted as public areas. Even so, releasing feces and urinating at the corridor is just ludicrous. Not only does it have a foul stench, it attracts pests and cause great trouble to everyone living on the level. What should we do? Does anyone have any similar experiences willing to share? I wish to take action fast and not make it a long term problem."

"[unpopular opinion] the reaction towards amanda lim and joseph schooling taking marijuana is similar to leniency for pervy undergrads with a ""bright future"" don't get me wrong, I think Singapore's drug laws vis-a-vis weed are dumb and need to change, but the sentiment/treatment towards the two swimmers from the powers that be comes from the same place as meting out lenient sentences to pervy undergrads with a ""bright future"".there is this entrenched bias towards and sympathy for ""high achievers"".

"Eating Disorders not getting enough attention and help in Singapore Posted a comparison on Singapore's estimated eating disorder rates in Singapore Raw a while ago and now that I have enough karma and found  even more ""shocking"" (for the lack of a better word) data, I thought I should post here. We actually topped Asia with data from a global health study but apparently a 2020 local study highlighted that we may be underestimating the estimates themselves...Worst thing was that the study mentioned that only ""1.6% of those who screened positive for an ED reported currently being in treatment"". As far as I know, only SGH has a dedicated treatment facility (KKH has doctors dealing with ED but not a dedicated team like SGH I think) and IMH isn't well-equipped either.   We keep saying that we should care more about mental health and stuff but I don't really see much being done per se to support facilities, infrastructure, outreach etc. More importantly, the stigma is still very much prevalent here...

"Polyclinics no longer reserve appointment slots for walk in patients? I remember when they first started doing the appointment system, i was told that they only had a limited number of appointment slots and the rest were reserved for walk in patients. At the time, i thought this made sense, because it meant that a certain number of appointments are reserved for walk in cases who might have gotten sick in the afternoon or something like that.But now it seems that no slots are reserved for walk in patients and all the appointment slots are quickly taken up in the morning before 9 am. So if someone gets sick later, it seems like they are screwed and have to go see a private clinic instead, which charges much higher prices? Just seems like the system screws people over who happen to get sick after 9 am and can't afford the fees that private clinics charge.Edit : **I am aware that you can book an appointment at 10 pm the previous days online**, the issue is that if you are sick after 9 am, you have no chance of seeing a polyclinic doctor because all appointment slots are already taken up, not even if you call or try to do a walk in."
"The astronomical increase in 3 room resale prices in the 4 cheapest non-mature estates from '19 to '22 vs wage growth for youths and seniors from '19 to '21 We are concerned with small resale flats because they provide immediate housing to young couples, especially crucial for those planning on having children, and for singles 35 and over. They serve as a benchmark on how affordable it is to get married/have children.**Key takeaway**For the cheapest non-mature estates of Woodlands, Bukit Batok, Jurong West, and Yishun, prices rose from $240,000, $258,000, $260,000, and $260,000 in Q2 2019 to $337,000, $345,000, $340,000, and $360,000 in Q2 2022. That's an increase of 40.1%, 33.7%, 30.7%, and 38.4%! (I picked 4 instead of 3 because the 3rd place was tied in 2019.)Edit: a dual citizen couple earning $5,000 and not staying near parents would get $95,000 in grants. After 95k in grants, a three room flat at the median price in Jurong West and Woodlands, which had the smallest and largest increase in prices, would be $163,000 and $145,000, and $250,000 and $242,000 in 2019 and 2022 respectively. This is a **53.4% and 66.9%** increase respectively, which also applies for your monthly loan repayments! The repayments for a maximum 25 year HDB loan went from $592 and $526 for Jurong West and Woodlands to $907 and $878! That's more than the cost of infant care after subsidies ($264)! While this is still below the 30% of monthly pay threshold, shouldn't we be alarmed by the dramatic increase? **Wage growth in youth?**However, the wage growth from June 2019 to June 2021 for youth below 35 (excluding NSFs, full-time employed only, including CPF) was negative to negligible, which is a very different image from the overall median wage growth. Those from 55-59 had significantly higher wage growth. Therefore housing has been even more unaffordable for young couples than those who have been just become able to start withdrawing from CPF. And now, the prices of the most affordable small resale flats will likely rise even further than 5 room and larger because of the loophole for those who are above 55 being allowed buy a resale immediately without having to rent/move in with relatives for 15 months in the new restrictions on private to non-subsidised resale downgraders.From ages 20-24, 25-30, and 30-34, the median wage was respectively $2,730, $4,081 and $5,197 in 2019, and $2,691, $4,095, $5,222 in 2021. This was a change of -1.42%, 0.34%, and 0.48%.This contrasts with the 2.56% increase in overall median monthly income from $4,563 to S$4,680 over the same period.**Wage growth in seniors and consequences for the loophole**What about those able to take advantage of the loophole in the new regulations? Those aged 55-59 had their wages grow from $3,563 to $3,729, or 4.66%. That's 82.0% higher than the overall median monthly income growth.Those over 60 had their wages fall from $2,562 to $2,543, or -0.74%. That's around half the percentage loss than those from 20-24. Therefore, since those from 55-59 had wage growth nearly double of wage growth across all ages, shouldn't the loophole be at least limited to those over 60? **Conclusion and disclaimer**The resale prices for 3 room flats in non-mature estates have grown by much more since before the pandemic compared to wages across the youngest and oldest age groups, which have remained flat or even fallen.While the calculations for the increase in resale prices at the start of the post included an additional year of increase compared to the wage growth data, the extent of total increase deserves to be calculated. And I'm too tired from typing this from my phone already to take the 2021 Q2 resale data and compare the increase between both 2019 and 2022.Edit: only a few estates are offered BTO every quarter and the attractiveness of the developments vary. New flats made available after MOP would significantly change prices that quarter and afterwards. I could have used an average of Q1 and Q2 prices to smooth that out, which is more important than matching the Q2 prices with the June wage levels.Compound annual growth rate might have been a better option instead of a simple percentage growth over the initial value, I'm not sure. For the least and most appreciating estates, Jurong West and Woodlands, the CAGR is 9.35% and 11.98%.Please double check my math and quote me without my username!**Links**Q2 2019 resale prices (Annex C):https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/release-of-2nd-quarter-2019-public-housing-dataQ2 2021:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/23072021-Release-of-2nd-Quarter-2021-Public-Housing-DataQ2 2022:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/22072022-Release-of-2ndQuarter-2022-Public-Housing-Data2019: MEDIAN  GROSS  MONTHLY  INCOME  FROM  WORK  ( INCLUDING  EMPLOYER  CPF )  OF  FULL-TIME  EMPLOYED  RESIDENTS  AGED  FIFTEEN  YEARS   AND  OVER  BY  HIGHEST  QUALIFICATION  ATTAINED,  AGE  AND  SEX,  JUNE  2019 (Table 23 Page 116)https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2021.aspx2021: (Table 24 page 128)https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2021.aspx(2020 figures were omitted because of the impact of the Circuit Breaker on statistics)The maximum HDB loan is 80% of the home value (down from 85% with the new cooling measures), 20% downpayment payable with grants and Ordinary Account.

This differs from MOE's sentiments that teachers are able to cope with their workload.A quarter of teachers reported working more than 60 hours a week - that is 12 hour, 5 day workweeks OR 8.5 hour, 7 day workweeks. But Chan Chun Sing thinks that a hard cap on working hours is unrealistic as teachers will still go beyond the call of duty to attend to their students' needs. But how much of that 60 hour workweek is spent on additional administrative tasks remains to be seen.Teachers shared that the top 2 issues they faced are 1) Lack of work life balance and 2) Excessive workload. Teachers reported finding it hard to establish and maintain boundaries between their professional and personal lives. They also mentioned about excessive workloads brought about by current teacher-student ratios and administrative duties like CCA or event planning.Chan Chun Sing when asked about excessive workload mentions vaguely about streamlining processes and giving autonomy to schools without elaborating on how these could help with the marking load or event planning issues brought up by teachers.  The previous education minister also [insinuated that our teachers are not experienced enough to make smaller class sizes work](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-cautious-issue-smaller-class-sizes-ong-ye-kung) and cites studies that say smaller class sizes do not relate to better achievement, but ignores all the others that show a positive correlation.With increasing numbers of special education needs (SEN) students in mainstream schools, teachers are stretched even thinner with regards to classroom management and ensuring that all students keep up with the curriculum.A sizeable portion also perceived systemic challenges such as a perceived lack of empathy from management due to the management's lack of understanding of their stress. But yet, MOE expects teachers to raise their concerns about burnout or mental health issues with their school leaders whom are also directly involved in appraising them, determining their bonuses and career progression. It's no wonder that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers who resigned pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving, or that only 10.8% of teachers turn to their supervisors as a source of support for workplace stress.No amount of mental health counselling, process streamlining or school autonomy to roll out new initiatives at their own pace will help improve our teachers' lives unless the bulk of additional administrative work (CCA/event planning or late-evening meetings) is addressed. Pushing the responsibility to [parents](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/respect-from-parents-also-key-for-teachers-well-being-chan-chun-sing) or school [alumni](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/school-alumni-can-help-ease-the-workload-of-teachers-says-chan-chun-sing) also does absolutely nothing to address these systemic issues.It's also laughable that MOE uses statistics from internal surveys, exit interviews and teachers' [responses](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cap-teachers-working-hours-1838626) to the minister as an accurate way to paint the situation on the ground. As though teachers would want to look incompetent, burn bridges or dare tell the minister that his ideals are anchored in la-la-land.If it was true that 7 in 10 teachers can cope with their workload or that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs, why did the survey conducted by SCC uncover that 81.1% of teachers had their mental health affected, 78.6% of teachers found their work-life balance lacking and 78% of teachers highlighting a longstanding problem with excessive workload?*\*All statistics and quotes were sourced from publicly available resources, with everything else being an opinion of the author and should not be taken as facts.*"
"Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again) What kind of a depraved mindset do you need to have to *accelerate* at a pedestrian waiting to cross at a zebra crossing or at a traffic light about to turn red? Why is the driving culture in Singapore *so* bad?Before anyone accuses me of generalization, I would like to tell you that that is *exactly* what I'm doing. I estimate that about 20-30% of drivers do this based on all my pedestrian years here living in SG.The only group of drivers that I can say are decent on the roads here are public bus drivers. Even though I could afford to drive, and I have a driving license, I would never want to. The stress having to deal with the driving culture here on the roads everyday is not worth it. Among other negatives.A bad driving culture is hard to change. We have moved from 3rd world to 1st world and even new generation of drivers are driving like this. What can be done to change this mindset? More rules? Fines? Cameras?Or maybe public bus drivers have undergone some kind of magical training that they can share with LTA."

"Is Singapore taking the right approach towards having kids? After much though I have decided to be kids-free. I realise that having children is often treated like another checklist item - get married, buy house, have kids etc. But bringing a human life into this world is such a huge responsibility. This new life will have to face challenges, ups and downs, heartache etc. So it is not something that should be dictated by public policy, GDP per capita, or supporting aging population. It should be guided by an immense sense of responsibility, maturity and commitment. Some ppl have kids because ""thats what they are supposed to do"" (their words) - i find this kinda thinking so irresponsible.  There are so many problems today (climate change, pollution, food security, income inequality) that are the result of growing populations taxing finite natural resources. As such how can I bring a life into this world which I know will be headed towards really hard times? Maybe it is high time society recognises this and re-writes the narrative about having kids. It should not rest on economics OR a life checklist. You cant just role out policies and say ""have kids"" - it doesnt work that way. We should rethink a future where there is a smaller population and it still continues to be economically viable - this would solve soo soo many problems in terms of housing, infrastructure, transport, immigration, jobs, and on a global level climate change, food security etc. But instead of thinking objectively about having children, ppl muddle it with religion, economics, tradition .... is it just me who feels that having kids is being taken for granted?"

"Ever wondered why scammers know your full legal name? YouTrip, owned by You Technologies Group allows users to be doxxed through entering random phone numbers in possible violation of PDPA. I happened to use YouTrip’s send money function and was appalled to find out that the “send money to unsaved number” function easily revealed the full legal name of any individual whose phone number was registered with YouTrip. I feel that this is possibly in violation of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and can and probably would be easily abused by unethical parties. Unlike other p2p money transaction services that allows a username to be linked to one’s registered phone number, youtrip straight up shows your full legal name.YSK if you have an account with YouTrip your full legal name and phone number are probably on some scammer’s excel sheet ready for the next fake job, fake parcel, fake china official scam.TLDR: Youtrip app can be exploited to show your phone number and associated full legal name. A goldmine for scammers."

"Some observations about the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), including underestimated travel timings on line maps and comparing its actual travel time with the North South Line (NSL) The Thomson-East Coast Line 3 has been open for more than two weeks. Since its opening, I have been taking the entire TEL up and down frequently, and have made some observations about the line.**1. How accurate are the travel times on platform line maps along the TEL?**Although the distance between two consecutive stations along the TEL is shorter in the city area, I still find it odd that it only takes 1 min to travel between most of them, especially when including the time that the trains dwell at the stations. For reference, I will embed the links to the platform line maps here:  [Woodlands North towards Gardens by the Bay](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QZ6j9nK7A6EvAUVaA)  [Gardens by the Bay towards Woodlands North](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f6Hw1YP95isdTPc77)I used the stopwatch on my phone to time the duration that the train takes to travel from one station to another and indeed, the actual duration is significantly larger than what is stated on the platform line maps, as stated in the tables below.When I recorded the data, all travel timings between two consecutive stations and dwell times at stations were taken at least 3 times each to ensure consistency and averaged. All timings were recorded outside of weekday peak hours, so I am not sure whether these timings will increase during weekday peak hours.To avoid making the post too long, I will post the travel and dwell times for individual stations separately in [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LO1lB0jptt8UJnlUYUd3KxYqSmKoyvIauf6DNYVlb5w/edit?usp=sharing) for those who are interested. The cumulative travel time for both directions is as follows.Cumulative Travel Time (From Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay)|Station|Line map|Actual time|Difference||:-|:-|:-|:-||Woodlands|2 min|1 min 43 s|− 17 s||Woodlands South|4 min|4 min 33 s|\+ 33 s||Springleaf|8 min|9 min 22 s|\+ 1 min 22 s||Lentor|11 min|12 min 32 s|\+ 1 min 32 s||Mayflower|13 min|14 min 57 s|\+ 1 min 57 s||Bright Hill|15 min|17 min 4 s|\+ 2 min 4 s||Upper Thomson|17 min|19 min 27 s|\+ 2 min 27 s||Caldecott|19 min|22 min 19 s|\+ 3 min 19 s||Stevens|23 min|26 min 11 s|\+ 3 min 11 s||Napier|25 min|29 min 30 s|\+ 4 min 30 s||Orchard Boulevard|26 min|31 min 21 s|\+ 5 min 21 s||Orchard|28 min|33 min 33 s|\+ 5 min 33 s||Great World|30 min|36 min 7 s|\+ 6 min 7 s||Havelock|31 min|37 min 52 s|\+ 6 min 52 s||Outram Park|33 min|39 min 55 s|\+ 6 min 55 s||Maxwell|34 min|41 min 50 s|\+ 7 min 50 s||Shenton Way|35 min|43 min 39 s|\+ 8 min 39 s||Marina Bay|36 min|45 min 20 s|\+ 9 min 20 s||Gardens by the Bay|40 min|48 min 40 s|\+ 8 min 40 s|Cumulative Travel Time (From Gardens by the Bay to Woodlands North)|Station|Line map|Actual time|Difference||:-|:-|:-|:-||Marina Bay|3 min|2 min 11 s|− 49 s||Shenton Way|4 min|4 min 24 s|\+ 24 s||Maxwell|5 min|6 min 14 s|\+ 1 min 14 s||Outram Park|6 min|8 min 0 s|\+ 2 min 0 s||Havelock|8 min|10 min 16 s|\+ 2 min 16 s||Great World|9 min|11 min 59 s|\+ 2 min 59 s||Orchard|11 min|14 min 13 s|\+ 3 min 13 s||Orchard Boulevard|13 min|16 min 23 s|\+ 3 min 23 s||Napier|14 min|18 min 15 s|\+ 4 min 15 s||Stevens|16 min|20 min 57 s|\+ 4 min 57 s||Caldecott|20 min|24 min 49 s|\+ 4 min 49 s||Upper Thomson|22 min|28 min 34 s|\+ 6 min 34 s||Bright Hill|24 min|30 min 56 s|\+ 6 min 56 s||Mayflower|26 min|32 min 58 s|\+ 6 min 58 s||Lentor|28 min|35 min 31 s|\+ 7 min 31 s||Springleaf|31 min|38 min 35 s|\+ 7 min 35 s||Woodlands South|35 min|43 min 34 s|\+ 8 min 34 s||Woodlands|37 min|45 min 41 s|\+ 8 min 41 s||Woodlands North|39 min|48 min 29 s|\+ 9 min 29 s|It seems that they also reduced the estimated travel times for TEL1 &amp; TEL2 after they opened TEL3. Someone told me that the platform line maps at Woodlands North and Caldecott used to state that it takes 23 min to travel between Woodlands North and Caldecott, which would have been more accurate, but now it states that it only takes 19 min to travel between these two stations. ~~Somehow the opening of TEL3 has made the trains travel faster lol.~~Therefore, do be more conservative if you are planning your travel time using the line map. Or perhaps you can just use the tables above.**2. Will taking the TEL instead of the NSL help you reach your destination faster?**Again, using the stopwatch on my phone, I timed the duration it takes for an NSL train to travel between stations where the NSL and TEL interchange (Woodlands, Orchard and Marina Bay). The results do show that it takes a shorter time to travel between Woodlands and Orchard when using the TEL rather than the NSL, but the time is almost similar for between Orchard and Marina Bay.Cumulative Travel Time (From Woodlands to Marina Bay)|Station|NSL line map|NSL actual time|TEL actual time||:-|:-|:-|:-||Arriving Orchard|37 min|35 min 55 s|30 min 48 s||Departing Orchard||36 min 53 s (Dwell time: 58 s)|31 min 50 s (Dwell time: 62 s)||Arriving Marina Bay|49 min|47 min 6 s|42 min 37 s|Cumulative Travel Time (From Marina Bay to Woodlands)|Station|NSL line map|NSL actual time|TEL actual time||:-|:-|:-|:-||Arriving Orchard|11 min|10 min 22 s|10 min 44 s||Departing Orchard||11 min 18 s (Dwell time: 56 s)|11 min 30 s (Dwell time: 46 s)||Arriving Woodlands|49 min|48 min 2 s|42 min 12 s|TEL time savings|Section|To Woodlands|To Marina Bay||:-|:-|:-||Between Woodlands and Orchard|6 min 2 s|5 min 7 s||Between Orchard and Marina Bay|−22 s|–34 s||Between Woodlands and Marina Bay|5 min 50 s|4 min 29 s|(Note that the time savings do not add up due to the difference in dwell times at Orchard)Therefore, commuters should take the TEL if they are solely taking the train between Orchard and Woodlands, but since the time saving is not that large, if their final destinations are nearer to the NSL stations, they should not change trains between TEL and NSL at Woodlands or Orchard since the time savings for TEL will likely be outweighed by transfer and waiting times.**3. Has the opening of TEL reduced crowding on the NSL?**Gone are the days when Northerners needed to jostle for space on NSL trains when an alternative option is now made available to them. Before TEL2 &amp; TEL3 were opened, it was common for commuters boarding the train at NSL northbound platform at Bishan during evening peak hours to wait for at least one more train before they could board, and platform queues may occasionally extend to the other end of the platform. However, this seems to no longer be the case. I have taken some photos (embed in the links) on [18 November (Friday), 7.16pm](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ujRHovRersb2VQPv5) and [21 November (Monday), 7.30pm](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PRXgUHTagynqgPFA8) during the evening peak hours which suggest that the crowding on the NSL has decreased significantly, and the decrease is more than what I expected (the eastern part of EWL did not seem to experience such a drastic drop in crowding when DTL3 opened), although part of the decrease may also be attributed to the school holidays and some remaining in the CBD for nightlife activities on Fridays.In fact, the crowding on the TEL is now pretty similar to the NSL, as you can see [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/F1ymm96ittxbWtAt5). Despite this, throughout the past two weeks, I have observed that no carriages displayed “yellow” on the “[Passenger Load Information System](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2018/5/2/factsheet-passenger-load-information-system-piloted-on-downtown-line-for-smoother-boarding.html)” (currently only available at the platforms of Downtown and Thomson-East Coast Lines), which suggests that the system is either faulty or it takes a lot for the system to turn “yellow” (then what is the point of the system when it is meant to divert passengers to less crowded carriages?).**Conclusion**The Thomson-East Coast Line aims to [bring residents along the North-South Corridor faster access to the city, relieve crowding on the North-South Line](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html) and [strengthen the resilience of our rail network by providing alternative travel routes for commuters on other lines](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2022/10/news-releases/thomson---east-coast-line-stage-3-to-open-for-passenger-service-.html). A few aspects of the TEL seem to be rushed/poorly done as already stated in this post, and also such as the cleanliness of trains (especially the dusty exterior) &amp; platform screen doors, and the [wrong platform line map used for the wrong station](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ys6n9y/how_did_this_happen_on_the_tel_its_not_exactly_a/). Despite this, I feel that it has done a pretty good job of achieving its aims. This is also evident when North East Line services were recently delayed twice on [15 November](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1592473146443313153) and [23 November](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1595354067521327104), and commuters were advised to [take the TEL to bypass the faulty section of the NEL](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1592494302676267008). Hopefully, when the East Coast section of the TEL and other MRT lines open in the future, more people will have nearby access to an MRT station and enjoy faster public transport journeys to places they want to go, therefore achieving Singapore's [aims of a transport network that is convenient, well-connected and fast](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html).

"Unpopular Opinion: Singapore wastes human capital of our youth and sets us up to fail Edit 5: TLDR; Aligning the academic year of our MOE schools and universities will give every Singaporean regardless of NS obligations an additional year to work post-degree. An additional year of income at the start of your working life, with compounding potentially translates to a major boost to your savings. This will be a boon for our economy since Singaporeans enter the workforce earlier and get to contribute more over our lifetimes. NS has nothing to do with my point, though a 3-month disruption would do wonders - I am very proud of my SAF service, and nothing will change that - I still carry my 11B around all the time. Those who think I'm salty about NS are missing the point.Edit 6: Please focus on the academic year misalignment in the discussion. The loss is an entire year, not 8 months - the other 4 are spent in kindergarten while kids in other countries have started P1 in August - our children have to wait for January.Edit 7: This is my last edit - my whining aside, I hope people carefully consider the effect of the misaligned academic year on our society. What is the economic loss? Who benefits from the cheap labor of a-level grads waiting for uni? I do not care what you think of me, but please; at the end of the day, I hope you will walk away with the sense that the misalignment of the academic year is a serious issue with grave national consequences that we can actually address through some firm decisions by the leadership; that this is an issue worth advocating.nvm, let's see how sordid this can get. keep the hate rolling guys, I want the karma.Edit 8: To those doubting my age. [https://imgur.com/a/Vf1pX3N](https://imgur.com/a/Vf1pX3N)Singapore's education system has an unconventional Jan-Dec academic year for MOE schools. This forces us to waste 8 months between graduation from school and university. We are a year older when entering university than students from other countries. Add in 2 years for guys who serve NS, and you can see that the average Singaporean throws away 2 years in the prime of their lives into a black hole (1 year for girls and 3 for guys). It need not be the case, especially for the year that is due to the academic year misalignment. I shudder to think of the sheer economic cost of this folly (of course, the impact on individuals is more important here, but as a nation we all suffer from this policy economically).I am 25 yo right now and only have a masters degree to my name, and just 4 months of working experience apart from internships. I tried to make up for lost time, finishing up my bachelors and masters in 4 years. But we're just too far behind. Being in the US, I feel like an utter joke, and I feel like a complete failure especially when my American/Chinese/Indian/European/Japanese friends the same age as me talk about the years of working experience they have under their belt or how they're defending their PhD dissertations. My supervisor at work is nearly a year younger than me. If I go in for my PhD now my advisor may be younger than me (if they're a fresh assistant professor). It is downright humiliating, in a way. Our biological clocks are ticking down, brains become duller and at some point starting a family becomes more important than your career. And MOE wonders why more Singaporeans don't pursue PhDs. We don't have time and are growing white hairs before we get the chance, dammit.Edit: Seriously, guys. The Government wants us to fight for our lunch and handicaps us by putting us in school uniforms when future FTs are in uni (literally). I'm advocating for a realignment of our academic year so that at a minimum, Singaporean women are able to get the same starting line as people from normal countries.Edit 2: I reiterate, this is NOT about NS. Why are Singaporeans stuck in JC uniforms when our counterparts overseas are already enrolling in uni? What is the economic cost of 1 year of earnings \* number of singaporeans affected by misalignment? NS is a totally different issue, but this affects everyone.Edit 3: My failures are my own. I own them, I do not blame anyone for them. What I am advocating is an improvement in national policy; that is, to get rid of the academic year misalignment. Difficult decisions will have to be made wrt resource planning to make this realignment work. But it can be done and will benefit future generations of Singaporeans. Our economy will benefit from squeezing an additional years' worth of work from degree graduates.Edit 4: The academic year misalignment means that schools start their academic years in January, while tertiary institutions typically start at a different time of year. This causes a gap in our educations, the effect of which is we lose a year of working life. Both poly/uni grads are affected, though to a different extent. It also affects you regardless of the path you took to get to poly/uni. If we realign our school system to enrol pri 1 students just 3 months earlier, we can give them an entire year of additional working life post diploma/degree that means more earnings and more savings compounded over the years, and more labor for our economy"

"Discussion on SIM swap attack Hi everyone, just wanted to have a discussion and also a PSA on the risks of SIM swapping in Singapore. My post was removed previously as I went into details on how to perform the attack so here's an abridged version without a step-by-step guide on how to become a criminal.Background: SIM Swapping attacks is when a cyber criminal takes over your SIM card and use that to take over your accounts. As these requires precise maneuvers, it's not realistic to do a blanket general attack and works well targeting specific individuals.As the adversary, you would find a target, preferably someone who is involved in cryptocurrencies as money-laundering is extremely through BTC/ETH/USDT tumbers. Finding a target is easy if you know how to dig for information online.After obtaining key information, the next bit is the most important: taking over the target's SIM card. With an NRIC, phone number and name, it's trivial to find the required information to take over the target's SIM card. You can find the target's telco by using the web portal of any telco. Login via Starhub, SingTel via phone number or NRIC. Telcos like redONE, TPG, CMLink, Singtel, Starhub, M1 will tell you if the NRIC/phone number is registered under their company.Here's the important part: sign up with TPG (Simba) and request for number porting. I use TPG as the postman DOES NOT check with the owner and simply delivers it as normal mail to you. Another alternative is e-sim providers like circle life and MyRepublic. I’m not familiar with the exact delivery and checks but a quick run through shows that circle life does not request for singpass. An attacker with a spoofed/leaked IC could pull this off remotely. Correct me if I’m wrong here. As SIM card porting happens at 12am to avoid service disruption, it also gives the adversary a time span of almost 6hrs to perform the hack. This is more than enough time for an experienced adversary to take over your entire net worth if you're not careful. One way of covering it up is buying cryptocurrency via debit/credit card and using a tumbler to money launder. Most e-wallets don’t seem to employ more security features and provides the debit card info in-app as well. A well planned attack could also directly target someone with a high value cryptocurrency exchange account. Key weaknesses:* Telco companies not securing their number porting process. No telco right now requires a photo of you holding your IC for number porting or new sign-ups. TPG does not even require actual verification upon delivery. (TPG please wake up your idea)* Telco companies giving away private information. With any number/NRIC in Singapore, it's almost trivial to check what telco the target is using.* Lack of 2FA on most platforms. Grab, EZ-Link, Shoppee, ShopBack, Fave and Singtel Dash do NOT support 2FA. Only a few of those listed above supports SingPass which is a much more secure way of logging in.* Allowing p2p to continue to exist: Singapore is not stamping this out and unfortunately this is a legitimate way to get hacked. What the government should do is legitimise this and require SingPass to register an account, rendering fake accounts almost impossible.How to protect yourself:* Get a burner number for PayNow, or stop using PayNow all together. Use bank account numbers directly to transfer instead of PayNow. * Use a private number for services and another public number for communication. This does not prevent data leaks from these services leaking your private number though.* Stop using SMS OTP and stick to 2FA like Authy, KeepassXC.* Use a password manager like Bitwarden. Seriously it's 2022, everyone should use a password manager.* Use a email forwarder like AnonAddy. Buying Protonmail's premium package also bundles such services for you so you won't be exposed in the event of an email leaks.What service providers (and governments) should do:* Stop outsourcing security to SMS OTP which is basically Swiss Cheese (full of holes). The telcos DO NOT care about security, not to mention SMS is unencrypted and unsecure. Even using email OTP is safer than SMS OTP.* Use SingPass as the OTP delivery provider. SingPass has an inbox feature which I find is a much needed gap between full blown 2FA and SMS OTP. Logging into SingPass requires a face scan and your account is disabled after multiple password attempts. By outsourcing the security to SingPass, most services can be locked down fairly easily. EZ-Link has the option to login via SingPass but does not mandate SingPass login and does not use the inbox feature either.* Allow end users to use 2FA. None of the service providers above allows 2FA which is beyond me.* Allow end users to disable SMS OTP. No point in using 2FA/SingPass if SMS OTP can still be used.* Banks should allow users to choose another number for PayNow. I want to use a public number for PayNow and a private number for OTPs from the bank. * As one commenter pointed out, PayNow setup should ask the owner to set it up with a nickname instead of a real name.Please let me know if I have anything wrong. This subreddit has a lot more savvy users and it'd be interesting to hear improvements and discussions on this topic.P.S. Popo please don't go after me. Too humji to do this."
"Young adults of Singapore, are you worried about the affordability of housing prices? Watched the recent the daily ketchup episode on property pricing and have to agree with most of what was discussed. As a single myself, I wonder where I am going to end up 5-7 years down the road. Am I even able to afford a hdb given how much prices have gone up while our salary has pretty much stagnated in the past 20 years."
"Help/Advise for mouldy room Hi all, i am desperate hence i’m hoping to find some help here cause i don’t know what else to do.My room hasn’t always been mouldy. It’s started some time in Feb 2022.The adjacent room beside was rented out and the aircon is constantly turned on, which resulted in my wall being fairly cold relative to the rest.I have tried to match the temperature of my room and the adjacent one. I have tried using those disposable and plugged in dehumidifier. I have tried keeping my room well ventilated. I have tried to use diluted bleach water to wipe down my furnitures and belongings. I moved my belongings away from the colder wall.None of the above works. The last straw for me is when i saw my new leather bag mouldy today. It is one of the few things I decided to buy and treat myself to and it has sentimental value. This mouldy situation is really driving me crazy. Is there a service provider i can engage or some advise that I can use to help with the situation?TIA"
"Sexual assault laws in Singapore (TW: graphic descriptions of rape)I did already report my rape to the police last year a few days after it happened, but AGC has decided not to prosecute after a year-long investigation. In asking this, I would just like to know what band of punishment my rapist would’ve fallen under, given the factors. Any theoretical info from lawyers, law enforcement, or those who are familiar with the law would be very helpful. My experience was:- I (23F at the time) had agreed to meet this older man for sex. He was a listed dominant (and I was generally searching for a dom, as a sub). We did not specifically discuss or agree to CNC or BDSM, just that he would be more dominant and that I would be more submissive. - Boundaries on safe words (including stop, no, I’m in pain), and gestures (including crying and pushing away, rejecting something) were discussed and he agreed to all of it before we met. - We met, and I realised he had brought BDSM items. - He asked to use rope on me for a BJ at the very start and I agreed. - Proceeding to consensual anal sex, he started escalating to going very deep and rough behaviour. In a lot of pain, I tried pushing him against his hips to get off but he did not budge. I’m not sure if he noticed; maybe it’s why he didn’t stop. - I started crying from the extreme internal rectal pain. He stopped and asked me why I was crying. I told him he was hurting me, that I was in a lot of pain. He told me: “cry harder”, and continued to do even worse while holding my lower abdomen / hips down. It lasted around 20 minutes. I was wailing and sobbing loudly at this point, until i dissociated and basically went into an autopilot, silently compliant state until it was all over (I don’t know if legally it means I consented to all of it). - There was a point where I could probably have run out stark naked but I was afraid he would catch me and get more violent. - Subsequently there was slapping, hitting my body with his belt, twisting of my skin, and handcuffing. - When he tried to get me to ride him vaginally, I told him it hurt and got off. He proceeded to hogtie me with rope so I could not move, and penetrated me repeatedly. - Subsequently he put a collar and leash on me, and used it later on to twist and choke me (he also did it with his hands) while sodomising me again in a different position, still extremely painful internally, because I physically could not look over my shoulder to smile at him while crying and sobbing. - Continued to sodomise me while I was crying, wailing and shaking my head as he asked me “you like fat (his ethnicity) dick raping your ass?” and other questions about being a good little whore for him. - Throughout the 2 hours+ of this, I kept asking for him to stop or for breaks. He pretended he did not hear me until he was finally done with me and said “now you can have your break”.- 5 mins later proceeded with forced stimulation for a long while despite me telling him to stop.- Wanted to send me to all of his friends to use as a sex slave.- Took photos of me, unsure if he circulated them although police said he likely did not. Some included my blood on his dick and fingers.- I sustained vaginal and anal tears, sprained neck, redness + some mild bruising, and some short-term rectal issues including bleeding. All healed within 1–3 weeks. Only lasting injuries is developing PTSD. I can’t figure out if this was an aggravated rape / purposeful violence (in addition to the violence of rape itself) or not, given the little time it took me to heal from the mild physical injuries, and given the circumstances of arranging to meet him, consenting to the act of casual sex at the very beginning before it escalated, and having silently complied (without verbal consent) to everything else he wanted to do after it did escalate.Will always carry the guilt and self-blame for those grey areas, but that’s another story. Does anyone have any suggestions on how aggravated this rape may have been (if at all)? TIA. (Sorry if this offended anyone.)ETA: i am not asking this question with intentions to try and get my case prosecuted. i know there is a serious lack of evidence for this case and have accepted that my case won’t be tried, it is also now closed for good (unless of course he gets charges brought against him by another person, which would in turn revive this case). so am just asking out of curiosity trying to figure out how severe my assault was in the eyes of the law, E.g. if it’s considered aggravated assault, or a Band 1, 2 or 3 offence!"
Are real estate agents part of the problem? Can't help but wonder if real estate agents are in part responsible for the unsustainable increase in property prices.When a certain BTO project hits MOP you can see them filling up the mailboxes and even knocking door to door saying how much profit the owner can get if they chose to sell causing the buy to flip mentally. I've also heard of stories where agents create a fake bidding war to increase offers for resale flats.What are your thoughts?

GST Hike Discussion This is just an opinion I have and I hope that people can change my mind on it.Why doesn't the Government raise GST by 2% in 2023 and avoid raising the rates two times in smaller increments. (Or to translate in Singlish: Why don't Govt just one-shot kill us all then slowly let us bleed?)Are they afraid of the possible hyperinflation that would come from a sudden jump in GST? Are they afraid that Business will raise prices? (even though they reconvene the GST committee...) Are they afraid of the possible economic impact that will come from the GST Hike?

"TIL: HDB officers never answer phone calls to their office number TLDR: If you need help from HDB and called up HDB branch service line, they will probably give you contact numbers (yes, sometimes more than one number) of the officer supposedly in charge. But watch out - these numbers never go through! Instead, you should ask the service line for the officer's office location and go down there!I recently sold my HDB flat to buy a new one, and had to deal with HDB several times due to different hiccups. The lesson I learned is that, the contact number of HDB officers that I got from HDB branch service line are useless. The officers won't answer those calls, some go directly to voice mail, some just no pick-up, ever. There was one time, I kept calling one officer for like weeks, until her voice mailbox is FULL - but still no answer or call-back! This happened again today, the officer‚Äôs number I got from HDB branch service line directly goes to voice mail. Knowing this is a dead-end, I decided to go down to the branch office that I believe the officer should be based in. I went down to the office, I asked the reception lady to help me speak to the officer, and guess what? The lady pulled out her mobile, dialled a number and got the elusive officer on speaker immediately! The reception lady later told me that she called the officer's personal number, not any of her work number - that's how we got to get her. I was also told the officer‚Äôs personal number will never be given to customers, so I will never get to speak to her on my own. Lesson of my story: if you need to find an HDB officer, don't waste your time calling their numbers, just directly head down to their office!Edit: about emailing - my experience with emailing HDB officers is a mix bag, some would reply, some would not. For those replying, it usually takes 4-6 days, which really doesn‚Äôt cut for urgent matters (when it comes to resale and renovation, most issues are urgent) Today at branch office, the reception lady actually helped me submit a document through her internal message system to the officer, she told me it‚Äôs faster than email. I got a reply from the officer in the afternoon, so much faster than I ever had with any email to HDB! Again, the gist is - when you need truly urgent help from HDB, try going down to branch office, the officers there make things happen so much faster then us calling and emailing on our own."

"Pls stop donating to scam charities I thought it was over a few years back, but it seems to have made a comeback after covid restrictions are relaxed.Have you seen those youngsters asking for donations, only accepting $10 notes, telling you they will use the money to buy rice or whatever??

Tbh they look as though they are unemployed and delinquents.Recently I just saw a guy holding that same clipboard being clingy to a lady and persuaded her to 'donate'. I tapped the guy and asked what kind of charity organisation they are helping and told the lady that it is a scam. Instead of explaining to me, the guy just ran away, so shady.Ok I dont know what charity name is printed on the papers, but if in any case I am wrong, pls lmk and I will take this post down. I just cant stand ppl using the name of 'charity' to con good-willed people of their hard-earned money. I was almost scammed myself cos the guy was pressuring me, but luckily I didnt donate.Pls just donate to legitimate organizations through proper channels, or I rather you just buy toto and donate to sg pools and they can donate on your behalf."

"My experience on applying to local Universities as an adult learner (for Citizens / PR) Disclaimer: am only a student. This post is written with the intention of general sharing only. Anything I say is solely based on my experience and what others have shared. (If I remember correctly) This pathway was first introduced in 2020 when all the autonomous unis started offering spots to adult learners who fit the criteria. Said criteria: (I) 25 years old and above as of 1 July of matriculating year, (II) have 4 years of work experience, (III) SG / PR citizen, (IV) does not have a prior degree studied/read.I applied in 2021 to: [SUSS](https://www.suss.edu.sg/full-time-undergraduate/admissions/eligibility), [SIT](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/adult-learners), [NUS](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/AdvanceNUS) and [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admission-guide/adult-learners-scheme). I did not apply to [SMU](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/programmes/smu-higher-education-pathway-adult-learners-heal), but they also do have their higher education pathway. Respective unis' adult learner pathways are called differently. Results: Was put on reserve for SUSS but eventually rejected, SIT and NUS rejected me too. Only NTU accepted me :')Other than the usual admin application process, here are the individual interview process:SUSS: zoom group interview with other applicants (probably fresh grad poly/JC).SIT, NUS: no interviewNTU: Online recorded interview. 6 general admission interview questions, 4 where they will record you, and 2 written. For the recorded questions, they will flash out the question, give u some seconds to think and they will start recording. You have 2 takes for each question. Can't really remember what they asked, but one of the questions was I think why the 6 choices and why in that order. Other questions IIRC are other behavioural type questions.Here's my timeline for NTU: Jan? or Feb 21: Submitted application7 May 2021: received email to do an online interview, 13 May 2021 deadline21 May 2021: received email saying I'm successful in my application for one of my choices Here's the big reveal LOL: I took pharmaceutical sciences from NYP and worked in a govt hosp as a pharm tech for 5 years (as a millennial I think it's a bit surprising that I managed to stay at a toxic job for so long, didn't chg job cos got comfortable but at the same time I felt like I wanted to upskill so here we are folks). In those 5 years, boss saw potential in me and sent me for Advanced diploma in pharmaceutical sciences. After serving my bond I was like..... what's next? I kind of knew deep down I only wanted to stop studying once I obtained at least a degree..... so yeah just nice I turned 25 in 2020 but because my birthday is in August..... :'))))) BUT ITS FINE I got accepted and that's all that mattersMy gpa in poly was...... 3.05..... y'all.............. if anyone has the same gpa, y'all can try applying!!! hahahaSome advice:(i) For NTU, please ONLY apply to SINGLE DEGREES. For all 6 choices. I did the mistake of putting double major...... lolAlso, I put my first 3 choices as biological sciences, thinking there's a higher chance that I would be accepted, and biz in the rest of my choices cos I felt that it's a course that would be easier to transition to from another diploma course. just FYI(ii) NUS requires you to give your latest CPF statement or payslip I think? also, NUS makes it compulsory for you to put your 2 referees and they have to be supervisors from your current workplace(iii) IIRC SMU requires you to submit personal statement. rest of unis don't haveQns I have received from other Redditors before:1. Does NTU ALS restrict the degrees that you apply for, depending on your diploma? - I guess not? I transitioned from a pharmacy diploma to a business degree. Though I think some O level subjects would help for some courses... like maybe Amath, POA, pure Geog, Pure sci, etc.2. What was your GPA? - 3.053. Course intake for each year? - idk hahaha but from the news, autonomous unis have now started giving [more spots](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/working-adults-may-get-more-opportunities-pursue-degrees-moe-funded-programmes-2544086) to adult learners !! what yall waiting for4. Do you get a class with other adult learners, or combined with the normal students? - combined. Think the adult learner intake is not that many for them to cater a specialised class for adult learners hahaha don't worry though, if you enter in the late 20s, you'll blend in pretty well.5. Do you click well with your peers? - Actually yes. Don't have to reveal your age or that you are an adult learner. Only tell when you're comfortable with it :) from my experience, I only reveal it to some of my groupmates... and don't think so much about how they are 6/7 years younger and you'll be fine.... HAHAHA6. Is there any fellow adult learners in your class or cohort? - have yet to meet any.... so yeah you can roughly gauge how ""rare"" I am7. How are you coping after a 4 year break from school? -  Lmao this question is üíØ hahha I mean I guess I‚Äôm doing ok, not too bad but not too good either, just floating and trying to survive. I feel like I‚Äôm an oldie cos my peers can sleep late and wake up early but I guess my body needs/want that 8 hours of sleep‚Ä¶.. so ya as long as you know your limits‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. just live in the moment and you‚Äôll do fine too üëçüèª 8. If I overload, can I graduate earlier? - for ntu I don't think you can overload........ you'd have to write in why you want to overload and you also somewhat need to prove that you can do well albeit overloading.... which means you have to I guess get FCH in y1s1? 9. Are we able to apply for financial aid like other students? - yesAll the best to all adult learners applying to uni this year! :)"

"On Raising NSF Pay. So, I made a comment a few weeks ago that was downvoted on r/NationalServiceSG \- because the premise basically was ‚ÄúAllowances don‚Äôt have to be raised just yet in light of the upcoming recession and financial situation‚Äù, something which I do still agree with to a certain extent. I had a sleepless night, woke up and went on a bit of a tangent to consider: \*how much would an increase in allowance actually cost?\* Let‚Äôs assume now that we are only adjusting Allowances to adjust to inflation rates, rather than dealing with the issue of how ethical being underpaid in allowances is.We must note here that for the sake of clarity that I‚Äôm not an Economist, Statist nor Political Analyst, and that many of these calculations are estimates. While my opinion will clearly be rather one-sided based on these numbers, I do think that the approach to these calculations can very clearly be flawed, and while I provide a little of my own opined commentary these are amateur observations and may not be as insightful as I wish. Lastly: opposing opinions are welcomed. While where I‚Äôll post this is likely to very much support these findings, there are very much valid places to nitpick or oppose the way I‚Äôve approached these statistics.**Inflation Rates, and (Proposed) Pay Rises:**Pay and allowance should always be allowed to match Inflation, to allow NSFs to afford the necessities and luxuries allowed to them ‚Äúin recognition of (their) contributions‚Äù (CMPB). A good estimate of a warranted increase in NSF pay would be to follow inflation rates, of which have been rather high by SG standards with the onset of the pandemic.Inflation Rates in 2021 and 2022 respectively were 2.3% and 6.7%, which isn‚Äôt really too bad considering COVID and the overall world financial situation. A rise of 7%, which I believe is a pretty realistic sentiment, would be a rise from \*SGD630\* to SGD674.10 for the lowest possible allowance allocated - to standardise everything, let‚Äôs just assume a $50 pay rise for all NSFs regardless of rank and vocation.**Number of NSFs and Total Cost:**Wikipedia notes that an average of 50,000 people serve NS annually - a number which isn‚Äôt really realistic, considering Resident Live Births per Singstat indicate 38,000-39,000 Singaporean Babies were born in 2001 and 2002 annually, falling to about \~35,000 p.a in 2003-2005. Halve these numbers for Males only, and being generous enough to round up, 18,500 Singaporean men at birth will enter NS annually. Add another 3,400 new citizens per year serving NS (Source: ST) and rounding up, we get 22,000 Singaporean men serving per year. Doubling that to highlight the total NSFs that would be in service this year, and throwing on some extras for good measure, *45,000 NSFs* would benefit from this pay rise as a super-rough ballpark estimate.Okay, basic maths would indicate that a rise in pay rates would be \~ 50 x 45,000 per month, which would be 2.25 mil per month higher spending, and *27 mil per year* additional financial pressure on the Military budget. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pretty expensive, but let‚Äôs take a look at comparative figures.**(A few) Comparative Figures:*** Janes‚Äô (A Military Journalism organization) notes that the SAF had an SGD 1 Billion rise in their budget from 2021 to 2022, to SGD 16.36 Billion, a 6.5% increase. This was attributed to, among other things, ‚Äúhigher construction requirements, including projects previously delayed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic‚Äù, and ‚Äúmodernisation plans laid out by the government in 2019‚Ä¶ delayed by Covid-19‚Äù. With some back of the envelope cost calculations (SEE COST BREAKDOWN HERE), the SAF spends a ballpark figure of around $455 Million per year on NSF pay. NSF pay thus makes up approximately 2.7-2.8% of the Singapore military budget. For comparison, the 27 mil increase would, well, comprise 2.7% of the $1Bil increase attributed to the SAF. Such an increase would thus be perfectly in line with the budgetary increases of the SAF.* In 2022, ‚Äúabout 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 (in 2022)‚Äù (source: ST), ‚Äúexceed(ing) Singapore‚Äôs core inflation rate of 5.1 per cent‚Äù (CNA). The main reasons for these pay rises were due to the competitive pay rises in the Private sector, while offsetting the rising cost of living due to inflation.* The GST hike, another reason for the increase in living costs, is likely to bring in an additional SGD 3.5 Billion p.a. by the full increase in 2024. A 27mil yearly increase for NSFs would make up approximately 0.77% of that annual budget increase.From an economic standpoint, I find it hard to justify not increasing NSF pay in light of budgetary and economic conditions. NSF allowances are small relative to the comparative private sector pay expectations - wage-driven inflation should not be a concerning factor given that wages have increased everywhere in Singapore. Even considering that NSF pay could be a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù, it can‚Äôt be overstated that with increases in living costs across the board - even in basic necessities such as transport and food - that this expected and thus essential source of income for NSFs should keep up with rising prices. If anything - should NSFs be paid only allowances due to our services being ‚Äúcrucial to the nation‚Äù, shouldn‚Äôt this minimal allowance be the first to increase, since it‚Äôs already the minimum expected to live on given our circumstances?If NSFs are to be at the forefront of the Nation‚Äôs defense, and expected to serve in light and despite of the challenges introduced by COVID and the economic and political turmoils over the past few years - they should be compensated at \*least\* to the same comparative standards as NSFs of years before. Even if NS ‚Äúcannot be measured by dollars and cents‚Äù - bus fares, Big Macs and Butter rolls all are, and the prices of those are burning holes in our pockets.

"Singaporeans are getting complacent about risk of extremism For 20+ years the Singapore Malay/Muslim community is successful in countering extremist ideology. Measures include licensing/regulation for asatizahs (teachers of Islam) + sermons/material to clarify misconceptions + religious counselling for radicalised Muslim Singaporeans + looking out for those at risk. That is why Singapore not yet kena terrorist attack compared to the communist threat in 1960s.I think this success made Singaporeans complacent about extremist ideology which can also come from other groups:* Many Christians in Singapore kena influenced by Trump like ideology (like the Indian boy who plan to attack mosques).* Many traditional Chinese in Singapore kena brainwashed by China propaganda.* Some liberal Singaporeans (usually with more economic privilege) are becoming more radical and polarising.* Some Malay/Muslim Singaporeans are getting tired of community efforts to counter extremist ideology. More are feeling alienated from wider Singapore society.There are many possible factors for the slight increase in extremist ideology in Singapore:* Impact of pandemic on Singapore society + social cohesion. For example, increase in racism against Chinese in 2020 then Indians during Delta. Many elderly forced to rely on digital media despite limited technical skills + limited media literacy (easily misled by fake news).* Impact of pandemic + inflation (also housing crisis) pushed many poor families to breaking point. To see rich Westernised Singaporeans enjoying life + elitism rubs salt into the wounds.* Extremist recruiters/influencers become smarter to use same psychology tricks as scammers + take advantage of existing fault lines in our society (like language barriers) + target most vulnerable.* Extremism from any group adds to mistrust/insecurity in other groups which can add to extremism in other groups leading to a vicious cycle/multiplier effect (not sure of correct term).Only a small percentage of Singaporeans believe in extremist ideology and among them only a small percentage will resort to violence. But if the above trends multiply the small percentage by 3 (example number) that can be the difference leading to hate crimes/first successful terrorist attack.True stories of two people I know who are affected by extremist ideology (details vague to protect identities):* A close friend from secondary school + his family are traditional Chinese but when they invite me to their place they serve halal food + his parents (Chinese educated with limited English) talk to me in Malay. During Covid his parents start to use Chinese social media a lot for news/music/movies + buy cheap stuff. His mother passed away due to Covid. While he + family are greiving (so burning more but still try to be responsible) kena conflict with another Chinese family over their burning. Then got financial/legal stuff to settle (like insurance/will) but the father don't know how (all in English) and tried to get help on Chinese social media. The father read a lot of China propaganda then kena brainwashed. He keeps telling his children he would support China to attack Singapore to kill all the jiak kantang Singaporeans who want to destroy Chinese culture + keep traditional Chinese Singaporeans in poverty. Even asked my friend to shoot jiak kantang Singaporeans during NS. Friend/siblings don't want to report him because he was a great father for many years + they scared they kena starved if he kena arrested.* A cousin (we grew up together) with special needs who is intelligent but naive + quiet. Pandemic dashed his family's (and mine) hopes of escaping poverty (his therapy also kena disrupted). He recently completed mainstream education (kena bullied a lot) but struggling to find job due to poor economy + racial discrimination + special needs challenges. He spends most of the time on the computer. Few months ago he shared in family Whatsapp group screenshots of LGBT supporters here insulting people who oppose LGBT rights as retarded + comparing them to ISIS.  When I found out he surfs a lot of extremist material I told his mother but she said better not report. She thinks with his condition he is not able to carry out any attack + police will not be able to handle him properly. She will try to find an asatizah familiar with special needs to talk to him but is not high priority compared to day to day economic survival.Hope we can take the threat seriously + have a rationale discussion about how to counter extremist ideology."

"Residential rental spike is about to significantly impact labor supply In case you have been living under a rock, rental for residential areas has gone up by a metric fuckton within the last 6 months. https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/singapore-rental-index-private-homes-rise-highest-in-24-yearsFor those of us who don't have our own place or live with our parents, this shit cascades downhill and splashes onto the foreign workforce and international students alike. As someone who was a landlord's rep and drafted more tenancy agreements than I can care to remember, most landlords prefer to stick to 1-year lease periods and the rental increases are looming very shortly.The people in my team at work are facing a ton of anxiety now. Most employers are not willing to offer raises to compensate for rental increases. It's very rare for employers to include rental support as part of their hiring packages. As a result I can ballpark 90% of my foreigner coworkers are preparing to resign and go home when their leases are done.3/4 of my interns are international students and this is hitting them particularly hard. Dorm rooms are not guaranteed even for international students and those students are staring down the barrel of increased rental eating up the budget they set aside for food. 2 of the interns are talking about transferring their credits to universities at home.This shit is serious. If the rental issue doesn't change anytime soon, my team will only have like 2 devs remaining. I suspect teams across the country are at risk of getting hollowed out unless it's some sensitive industry like defense or intelligence. We also run the risk of chasing international students away. If you're working and aren't losing your shit over this, you should be."

"Institutional racism in Singapore I'm gonna try to make this as uncontroversial as possible (if it is even possible). Obviously it's a sensitive topic, and people have differing views.But I think by and large, a lot of the racist stuff we see in sg are more societal rather than institutional, like the dude saying interracial marriages are wrong, landlords not wanting Indian tenants, etc. When we look at an institutional level (aka the govt policy), there's very few (or some would say no) overtly discriminatory policies. Any policy that is debatably ""racist"" often has some mildly legitimate reason for existing. Whether you agree with the given reason is another matter, and not the point of this post. But there's one policy I can't wrap my head around that I think is totally inexcusable but somehow not talked about enough. And that is, how the government classifies malays/muslims as being ""less loyal"" and hence deemed to have lower security clearance when working in govt and even during NS. The only argument I've heard is ""what if sg goes to war with Malaysia"". Which makes 0 sense. Because Chinese who were born/have parents from Malaysia are somehow alright. But a malay who has lived here for generations is more likely to betray sg. We even have ministers like khaw boon wan who was born in penang and no one bats an eye.The government doesn't even have a response. I've tried searching it up, and their response just boils down to denying it happens and alluding to not being able to disclose this for national security reasons. Every other policy that involves race, from ethnic quota for hdb, sap schools, grc, or whatever else, there is at least an attempt to justify their position. Not for this.And it has a very real impact. Civil servants and military personnel are literally prevented from promoting because of this. I recall there was a post sometime back of someone being let go from the civil service, with hints of it being due to her security clearance/race. It fits the most literal definitions of institutional racism. It is the state discriminating on the basis of race.Do people think this is a serious problem, or am I just exaggerating the magnitude of this?"

"Can the government tweak COE policy to make it more fair? Details inside! **TL;DR at the bottom!**If someone suggested this before and there was a constructive debate over this, please link me. I can't find anything in recent history.Here's my idea that I hope any sensible MP can bring up regarding our ridiculous COE prices.The whole reason for 'COE' was originally to control the number of cars on the road so traffic is sustainable. Fair enough. Now it's widening the inequality gap between rich and poor. I know rich people whose households own multiple cars. The father, wife, son, daughter, everyone in the immediate family has their own car. 1 person might even have multiple cars in their garage. Bidding for the COE is literally not an issue for them. Even if COE is 200k tomorrow they will snap their fingers and buy a new car because at that point of wealth, the price doesn't matter anymore. Do you think they feel alot of pain when their Porsche costs $900k instead of $800k?Meanwhile, middle and lower income families could really use a family car to settle their transportation needs. The utility value for them is so much more important than the wealthy dude who needs a *10th Ferrari to flex*.**How to solve this?**Why not let every *Singapore Citizen* household (with minimally a married couple, with or without kids), to have their first COE subsidized (can scale according to their income level!) or price capped to something more *reasonable* e.g. $30k? Then, every subsequent car that you want to buy within the household (like if you're getting a 2nd car within the family), the price of that 2nd COE will skyrocket to $200k (I'm using random numbers here btw, you get the gist that the 2nd COE price should be deservedly higher because it's a greed, not a need for the family). If you still want to greed a 3rd car, 4th car, the COE becomes exponentially higher like $300k, $500k. Because a mega-wealthy person that can buy multiple cars without flinching can contribute to the subsidy this way. And a lot of people like that exist in Singapore, just take a walk around Bukit Timah estates. Not even exaggerating here.*It is still an auction system btw - the supply of COE will still be controlled and limited by the govt. LTA can decide exactly how much subsidy they can give to first-timers. The point is to not let the auction spiral out of control due to wealth inequality.*This solves the **first counter-argument** to this proposal - if people want to say the government has to commercialize COE like a business, then LTA still gets their profit - but at least they extract more money from the upper-rich class who insists on having more than 1 car. Households (especially those with kids to fetch) who really need that ONE car will be happy to pay a subsidized fee, and rich families (who really WANT that 2nd car for pure flexing, idk) will also be happy to pay a more expensive $200k COE. I mean, if you're a 'rich' family and you're not happy at paying an additional $100k levy for multiple cars then maybe consider that you don't really need a second car in the first place? The irony right?**Second counter-argument:** you may say that COE prices are sky-high now because of all the private-hire companies buying up COE bids and placing more rental cars on the road - in this case, there should be a separate category for private-hire car COEs. Let all the corporate companies have a bidding war against each other. Let it be a free market competition amongst the corporate giants. Leave us peasants out of it. I really don't care if Grab or Gojek or Tada goes bankrupt and loses the war. With this implementation, the demand for private-hire car rides will naturally drop because most lower and middle income families are able to have their own family car, and we won't see the need for so much parents ferrying kids around in grab. A side-effect is that more people will take public transport too, if the prices of taking Grab becomes too disgustingly high because of this new implementation.**Third counter-argument:** Single people! (I'm single too btw). There can be a single-bid category as well, but I expect this to be as expensive as our current COE prices, being left up to free market forces (*but without the pesky private-hire companies chupping in ofc*). If you have proof that you moved out from your parent‚Äôs home and are living an independent life, you can be decoupled from the multiple car category above. If you have a better idea to this, comment below!**Final counter-argument:** If the household has way too many kids (&gt;4 kids), they may consider appealing to the government for a subsidized COE for a 2nd car due to the nature of having a large family, and this appeal is more likely to go through especially when the kids have gone past &gt;25 years old and are of working age. Anyway, I think this problem may solve itself because if all the kids are finally in the working stages of their life, they can consider getting married and create a new household, thus being eligible for their 1st car subsidy.*I also want to add a footnote that we have an aging population - i.e. lower birthrates and not enough kids to replace parents. Since this implementation should only apply to citizens (PR debatable), the supply of first-time car owners on the road should be decreasing over time, so the subsidy system should be sustainable over a long-run.*Redditors, economists and philosophy PHDs, please feel free to chime in, poke holes in this theory, and explain why no MP ever thought about this yet in parliament :(**TL;DR** COE system should change - 1st car for every family household be heavily subsidized, then any additional car without legit reasons should be slapped with a way more expensive COE to make up for the subsidized ones. The supply of cars on the road will be the same.EDIT: I see good suggestions that the subsidy should be removed, just slap ABSD on the 2nd/multiple car COE owners, which will naturally bring down the price of the 1st car COE owner. Thank you and that was smart.People also mentioned we will be flooded with cars on the road with the subsidy. I don‚Äôt think this will be the case because we are only asking for a subsidy, not a free COE. Families still have to think twice if they need to pay 50% of current COE price, which is still like $40k (not including the car)."

Pretty much the same how it was experienced. I had 3 relatively large plastic bags kinda like ikea sized bags but slightly smaller. They were filled with new clothes and bags. Plastic bags were new and clean. Gojek Driver in Honda Vezel (SUV) arrived. Stepped out to help load one of the bags and then promptly changed his mind and told me he cannot take me because I need to book a 6-seater. Mind you, I‚Äôm the only passenger. There‚Äôs plenty of space inside and at the back. Even if there isn‚Äôt, my items can be squeezed to fit. The driver also mentioned that I need to book a 6-seater if I‚Äôm carrying many items with me. I told him that was nonsense especially when my items are not bulky. Never had issues when I had bulky items from with me. He drove away and canceled my ride after 5 mins. I was charged $4 by GoJek for him cancelling on me. I ended up booking a cab that came in a prius. My 3 bags fits just fine with some space available for the cab driver‚Äôs items. So what, are we not allowed to carry anything heavy when we book a 4-seater grab or gojek now?Did something change that triggered such behaviour among PHV drivers? Or am I just unlucky to such a driver? Perhaps the latter.*EDIT 1*: My $4 got refunded within the same day of incident. Gojek also gave me a call. Assured me that driver received demerits for this issue and they will be contacting the driver on the matter. Also confirmed that driver cancelled on me instead of a ‚Äúno-show‚Äù. They additionally assured me that they do not tolerate such behaviour. I can only trust that they did what they did."

"Beware of Scammers Using Local Phone Numbers: My Experience with a Call from 8763 xxxx Earlier today, I received a call from a number starting with 8763 xxxx. The person on the other end claimed that there was a dispute on my DBS credit card transaction and asked me to talk to customer service to avoid illegal usage.Normally, I don't entertain any calls starting from +65 (as they are often scams). However, since the number was local, I decided to pick up. The person had a very localized voice, which led me to believe that the scammer might be in Singapore or Malaysia. I asked him about the nature of the dispute, and he replied that he would need my information first, starting with my name, to proceed. I declined and told him that I would call DBS hotline to find out more information.I went to a nearby DBS branch and spoke to the staff there. After a 15-minute discussion and checking my account, they told me that there was no suspicious activity going on. I provided them with the phone number and informed them about the scammer, who seemed very convincing with the local number and localized speech. The staff asked me not to worry, as there was nothing going on, and discarded the paper where they noted the number.I wonder why such complaints are not taken seriously, especially when the scammer could be located locally or in a neighboring country."

Even more appalling is I had this condition during my teenage years and it‚Äôs now 10 years later so obviously things have changed. Has anyone had similar experiences?

The Customer Support representative explained that it's a special offer that is currently free but will automatically be charged after 6 months. Has anybody experience with such situations where a company just changes the agreed services and additionally intents to charge you without your approval? M1 is unwilling to connect me with somebody to talk about and clarify the situation - they only promised a call-back which is likely not going to happen.   https://preview.redd.it/7dwrpiq1napa1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f98db2ec09cbfa4f0c2c8c8f6620b28d62515162https://preview.redd.it/stgiu660napa1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a4ce1862d764567d97f67f24676276ad2d83fda0"
"How are renters figuring out the real market rate? Looking at places to rent, the asking prices are much higher than recent rents paid for similar units (based on URA and HDB data).I made a few offers based on an average of recent rental rates. But got ghosted by agents.So how are renters figuring out the actual ""market rate""?"
"Encounter with a possibly racist woman on the train berating a family over their luggage taking up space (more info in description) It's 12-ish, and I'm on the train. A family is sitting nearby with their bags and luggage. Anyone else on the train could see that they put their things as close to them as possible, trying their best not to take up space. Lady walks in, without any provocation, and shouts at the family, saying that they make it impossible to sit down in the seat next to the father, because of his luggage. The father moves his luggage out of the way best he can, but she still shouts at them, calling the situation (or them) ""outrageous"".At the next stop, a new passenger boards the train and she sits next to the father - in the ""impossible to sit down"" seat. The voice recording was after this.As in the picture, the woman had her umbrella on the seat. At the next stop, an elderly man boarded and wanted to sit in the seat next to her. She had to move her bag and umbrella away for him to sit.I was preparing to leave at the next stop, the family was going to get off at the same stop. I stood up and told the woman - ""Look, your umbrella was on the other seat and the other passenger didn't have to shout at you to get you to make space. Why did you have to shout at them? Have some compassion."" She shouted back at me something like ""Speak for yourself!"" or something along those lines. Still mega confused about that.Talked to the family when we got off and found out that they are tourists and they've already been having a really tough time finding their way since leaving the airport. To add to that they had to deal with this. Up to this point, they have never expressed anger or replied rudely or even raised their voice.Am in contact with them, and told them that if they need any more help or if they want to make a report, to just drop me a text.Still pretty appalled at what happened. I'm hoping they won't have to deal with more people with shitty attitudes while they're here."

"Demand surge and inflation from extreme labor force growth in 2022 The Labor Market advance report for 2022 was released by the Ministry of Manpower about two months ago (31 Jan 2023). You can find the preliminary labor figures at [https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/labour-employment-wages-and-productivity/latest-data](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/labour-employment-wages-and-productivity/latest-data).

Between Dec 2021 and Dec 2022, the labor force grew by 146,600 workers. And this does not even count foreign domestic workers! If we include FDWs, then the total rise in employment over 12 months is a quarter million (or a 6.9 percent growth Y-o-Y), the largest ever in Singapore's history in absolute numbers. This even exceeded the 2007/2008 numbers (as can be seen in the below chart).  [Screenshot taken from https:\/\/tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg\/table\/TS\/M183901.

There was a massive labor force surge in 2022, the largest ever in Singapore's history. What the hell was MOM thinking? If you expand the labor force by 6.9 percent within a year, then you will get a ton of inflation. What is worse is that the 6.9 percent growth in employment level only translated into a 3.8 percent growth in the economy (MTI preliminary estimate [here](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/01/Singapore-GDP-Grew-by-2_2-Per-Cent-in-the-Fourth-Quarter-of-2022-and-by-3_8-Per-Cent-in-2022)). This means that the marginal productivity growth from the labor force growth is already *negative*. We have pretty much gone back to the good old days of powering economic growth through labor growth."
"Polyclinic shortage of appointment slots is just ridiculous nowadays.... I remember about a decade ago, I got sick at work and could still walk in to see a polyclinic doctor in the afternoon, no appointment needed. This wasnt a one off occurence either, there were several times i had to see a doctor in the afternoon and were able to walk in and see one. Makes sense right?Now, you have to book the night before, so that means if you are sick on the day itself, **you have no chance of seeing a polyclinic doctor**.Case in point : I just tried to book an appointment for National University Polyclinics...all slots are already taken. If someone wakes up in the morning, is sick, and needs to see a doctor...they have no chance of getting a slot. GG.In the past, they also had some slots reserved for emergency walk in cases on the day itself. Now, there is no such thing (they explictly told me there is no such thing), everything has to be booked before hand, and all slots are taken up the night before.How have things gotten so bad? I cant afford to get my meds from a private GP because there is no subsidy (CHAS doesnt cover the cost of medications and CHAS orange only covers $10 out of a typical $50+ consultation fee). It just seems ridiculous to me that there are no time slots reserved for sick people on the day itself...how can anyone predict ""yea, im going to be sick tommorrow, better book a slot now""? The polyclinic appointment system is just illogical the way it is designed..."

"A food delivery guy on an e-bike almost hit my baby in her stroller today. I suppose this is more of a rant than a discussion. I want to clarify that this took place at an off-peak hour (12pm on a Saturday) on a pedestrian path where e-bikes are banned. There was a scaffolding that blocked the T-path that I was approaching, and my spidey-senses told me to check before pushing the stroller out. Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out ‚Äúsorry sorry‚Äù as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number. He told me he seemed apologetic and he let him go, where the rider then dismounted and pushed his e-bike until out of our sight.This is where the struggle comes in: because there was no hit / damage, I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I can‚Äôt report him as I don‚Äôt know what platform he works for. I can‚Äôt get the police involved as there is no license tied to his vehicle, despite a legal ban that was laid out to prevent exactly such incidents. I am not against riders - I deeply respect that they are out there to make their livelihoods, but is your delivery more important the safety of my child, or your own safety? Is the near-miss not enough for you to feel to need to slow down and check if we are okay? Are you going to blatantly ignore this incident and cause a bigger, more painful lesson for someone else or for yourself?Should we have collided, your ‚Äúsorry‚Äù will not un-scar my 9 month old, or me. Your biggest issue would not be a missed delivery, and both your day and mine would have turned out very differently. You‚Äôre still out there making deliveries because I hesitated to push my baby‚Äôs stroller out onto the pedestrian path that I had every right to access on a Saturday afternoon. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do but to share this incident for more awareness towards pedestrians and riders alike to not take our road safety for granted.Thank you for reading this post."

"Road Planning needs overhaul to curb dangerous driving and encourage alternative transport instead of driving Even though I primarily get around via a motorcycle, I think more work needs to be done on our roads to make walking and cycling more comfortable, instead of making it more convenient to drive around in as it currently is. Hence why the private vehicle population is staying high even though COE prices keep going up.I believe other than how straight Orchard Road is, I think it ought to be a gold (silver?) standard by which more roads should be arranged in the rest of Singapore.It is an incredibly walkable area with plenty of space for pedestrians and cyclists to share side by side, it is well protected from traffic, and there is still space for green verges. One way traffic reduces the likelihood of accidents though I personally would prefer if they depended less on traffic lights and more on winding paths to control speeds. It also forces drivers to plan ahead and be methodical while driving, lowering their speed lest they miss a turn. It also may make it a decision factor to take public transport instead if the route proves to be more of a hassle.Now look at the vast majority of minor roads in heartland areas. 2 way traffic with Singapore's hallmark straight-as-an-arrow roads, with as many lanes squeezed in as possible taking away space from pedestrian footpaths, making it a pain to walk that 2 or 3 bus stops away to the MRT station to save money AND time even though it is not far, much less cycle it.By just taking your typical 6 lane bi-directional road, cutting it down to a one way 3 lane road that turns off both left and right into respective buildings/estates, we can give pedestrians and cyclist so much more space to move around without coming into conflict with each other. Making the roads wind a bit like they did at Hougang St 21 and several Silver zones have also proven to curb speeds and create jutting pockets we can plant bigger trees for shade.I think we have the building blocks to make more non-trunk roads convenient for peds and cyclists, at the expense of drivers if it comes down to it. But it just annoys me that even though there have been initiatives to retrofit some areas as I've mentioned above, a lot of new roads in new estates are still being designed to make driving in and out more convenient than it is to walk and cycle around, like the new Bidadari Park Drive (though to be fair they included a cycle path on one side of it).Will narrower, winding one way roads affect the bus transportation network? Yea it will, especially if you need to travel along specific routes in both directions. But I sincerely think we ought to be increasing the density of the MRT network so busses aren't such an essential node in the transport system as it is now."
"Suffering from Severe depression and seeking subsidised options via IMH Hi all,Seeking for inputs from folks who have went through the route of assistance for mental health issues through IMH.I am a middle aged male, married with 2 young kids. Been refusing to acknowledge that I am suffering from depression and gritting my teeth and thought I need to just man up but I think that is no longer possible. Family relationships suffered due to my mood swings and constant anger and lousy moods. I also resigned from my full time job last year as I couldn't handle the stress of working long hours every other day and it became very very very difficult to wake up every day and to get to work. Wife saw symptoms which I denied and gave ultimatum is either get help or we separate as she cannot handle my anger, pessimism, and constant nagging and borderline verbal abuse on occasions.I am seeking subsidised assistance because wife is shouldering 80% of the financial responsibilities at home with the expenses for the two young children while I pay for utilities and various groceries expenses. I am relying on my savings accumulated over the years and doing some part time work at the moment to get some pocket money. I am also currently aggressively applying for full time work but since beggining of Jan 2023, there has not been any calls for interviews.Can any kind souls on reddit share their experience if any via IMH and what is the route they took to get subsidised mental health assistance.Thank you all in advance.Edit: thank you all for sharing your experiences and also the many information. Will need a bit of time to sift through and explore the best options. As this matter I raised is really foreign to me and I never thought I would be having to get help...Update: got a referral from polyclinic and the appointment with IMH is in June. Not too bad all things considered."
"SimplyGo Phone Users - Do you have a harder time tapping with your phone at Thomson-East Coast Line compared to other lines? The gantries in the TEL all uses full-screen display and does not have a physical sensor (or rather, the screen itself is one).But I generally have a harder time getting the gantry to detect my phone NFC at TEL (when the line first opened, at one point I tried to get the gantry open for a full 2 minutes!)Placing the phone right on top of the screen, didn't work. Sliding it up and down, didn't work. Need to raise my phone up a certain distance slowly for it to open - and sometimes I just try to move my phone up and down.Nowadays, I found the range to get the gantry open - usually 5cm above the screen, and then just gently yo-yo the phone up and down while rotating the phone a bit (my phone's NFC is at the upper part), usually takes less than 5 seconds of trying.But the same phone gets detected instantly on other MRT lines."
"New Job Scam Modus Operandi Recently, I've received WhatsApp texts asking you if you're xxxx (they get this name from my telegram name), and asking you to answer some survey questions for cash. They'll claim to be from some reputable company like Grab, Shopee, NUS, etc. If you entertain them, they'll pass on your contact to another scammer on WhatsApp who will ask you to do a simple task for cash. Basically, you'll like some YouTube video, screenshot it and send it over. They claim they're helping influencers farm likes. If you pass this, they'll reward you with around $20, and ask you to contact some 'receptionist' on Telegram. He will add you into a telegram group to do the YouTube likes task, and each like gives you around $4. After doing a few liking tasks, they'll ask you to do the so called 'prepaid' tasks, where you will pay them a sum of money and they promise to return you your initial payment + a bonus. Seems like they're getting more and more creative with their scams. Needless to say, do not ever send any money to them regardless of how tempting it may be. I heard from my friends that they'll actually pay you back for the first few prepaid tasks, but i do not recommend doing it."

"With all the news on housing prices, how should Singapore fix its housing problem? As someone who has yet to own property in Singapore, I'm concerned about the housing prices and my future ability to move out of my parents. I'm sure many of us have similar concerns.In the spirit of fostering productive discussion, instead of simply complaining, what do you think would help relieve the housing prices in Singapore? If the problem is too complex to be solved in a short period of time, what should we start doing now? Also, does the government even want housing prices to go down? It will hurt the older generation because all of their net worth is in their houses, and that is the generation running the country right now.Personally, I'm by no means an expert, but I still think Singapore is still relatively low-rise and spread out. For example, compared to NYC, where all buildings are high-rise with not much spacing in between. I imagine Singapore has the potential to increase housing supply by a lot. Just thinking out loud here.EDIT: Also, is public housing really the answer to the problem? Based on what we know on the efficiencies of private markets vs bureaucracy, can we really depend on HDB to be the project manager for a large portion of Singapore's housing market? At what point would it be too much for HDB to handle? If private markets are able to lead to large increases in housing supply, it could lead to deflationary pressure instead of the usually assumed inflationary effect.EDIT2: I posted this right before the government announced new property cooling measures lol."

"HDB unit on the top floor? Think again, says one property agent According to property agent Shiddique Asyraaf, those two flat types, along with a low-floor unit facing a rubbish chute, are ones to stay clear of. In a TikTok video posted last Saturday (April 22), Asyraaf advised against buying a maisonette, as most of them are ‚Äúat least 30 years old"", which would make them difficult to sell less than 20 years on. ""The [executive maisonette] would be 50 years old [by then],"" he explained. ""For buyers who intend to fully utilise their CPF and loan up to the maximum valuation limit, they have to be at least 45 years old to buy an executive maisonette.""As a seller, this would limit the pool of buyers considerably, he said. Valuation limit refers to the purchase price, or the value of the property at the time, whichever is lower. Also, CPF funds may only be used up to a certain point depending on the age of the property.Not surprisingly, low-floor units facing the rubbish chute aren't the best option either.Asyraaf said these homes are ""one of the more challenging units to sell"", for obvious reasons. Units on the highest floor are typically popular among home buyers ‚Äì for the view they offer, and exposure to light and breeze, among other things.   But think again, said Asyraaf. The first issue is the heat due to exposure to the sun, he said. Then there‚Äôs the issue of the lift breakdowns.While many in the comments section agreed with his points regarding the maisonette and the chute-facing units, they seemed divided over the top-floor flats. Asyraaf advised first-time buyers on being clear on their priorities and preferences before going house shopping. Is having an MRT station nearby important? What amenities need to be close by? It‚Äôs probably wise to keep a lookout for clinics, schools and supermarkets.Then again, while a nearby hospital might sound handy, do consider the constant noise from ambulance sirens."
"Do you think the eligibility criteria for HDB's Enhancement for Aging Seniors (EASE) Programme should be more flexible? For those who are unaware, the Enhancement for Aging Seniors (EASE) Programme offered by the HDB facilitates the installation of improvement items in HDB flats to reduce the risk of seniors falling at home when using the bathroom. Examples of these items include grab bars in the bathroom, as well as the application of slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles in the bathroom. More information on the EASE programme is available [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/ease).However, the eligibility criteria for direct applications of HDB's EASE programme is rather stringent and lengthy, requiring the household to have seniors above the age of 65, and/or seniors between the ages of 60 & 64 who require assistance with at least 1 Activity of Daily Living (ADL). It also requires 7 working days and the contractor to conduct an assessment of the flat prior to official installation.My mother (age 59) recently suffered a distal femur (thigh bone) fracture while using the bathroom. After the surgery and 1-month rehabilitation in the community hospital, it was determined that she requires assistance in at least 1 ADL for between 6 and 12 months. Thus, the physiotherapist encouraged my household to apply for HDB's EASE programme to implement some improvement items in the bathroom to reduce the risk of my mother suffering another fall. As she isn't 60 years old yet, the HDB requires a Functional Assessment Report (FAR) to justify the need for approve HDB's EASE program, which results in a longer waiting time for the improvement items to be retrofitted.As if the lengthy process of assessing the average household for the implementation of HDB's EASE improvement items is already long enough (i.e. 7 working days), the need for the submission of an FAR to proceed with the application is certainly frustrating, especially if you have a senior at home who's in urgent need of these improvement items.Thus, here are some questions for fellow redditors who have experience with the direct application for HDB's EASE programme, and/or have seniors at home who require assistance with at least 1 ADL:* Is HDB right in justifying having an FAR in order to proceed with an application for HDB's EASE programme for households with seniors below 60 years old but require assistance with at least 1 ADL, but requires the improvement items urgently? I understand how some households may try to game the system during their application. However, shouldn't a senior suffering a fall at home be the best justification for why the EASE improvement items are needed urgently?* Do you think HDB should exercise greater flexibility when processing EASE applications for seniors below 60 years old, but require assistance with at least 1 ADL, by:1. Lowering the minimum age to 55 years old? After all, the risk of falls in the bathroom increases once a person reaches 50 years old, where their bones are more brittle. It wouldn't matter whether the senior is in his/her 50s or 60s once the fall happens.2. Reducing EASE application requirements for seniors below 60 years old who need assistance with at least 1 ADL? Allow hospitals to directly submit the EASE application to HDB with the necessary medical reports for verification purposes, without having the affected household being made to wait for extended periods of time for the approval because of the need to submit an FAR."

The graduates from NYP were invited to convert their Diploma to Degree with SIT and the partnering overseas university (Yes, even the super senior Therapists took a break from work and went back to study). Hence, it would be more meaningful to look at the salary for Therapists who are degree holders. On 3 March 2023, ChannelNewsAsia published an article titled ""Salaries for social service sector to go up by between 4% and 15%‚Äù. The only part that talked about Therapists is ‚ÄúThe wage increases can potentially benefit more than 20,000 employees in the social service sector comprising social workers, therapists, psychologists and early intervention educators among other professions.‚Äù No further elaboration regarding how Therapists‚Äô salary would change.On 14 April 2023, The Straits Times published an article titled ‚ÄúCare staff being paid less this year? Realignment of roles the reason, says NCSS‚Äù. The article did not mention anything about Therapists. I don‚Äôt understand why the salary for therapists is adjusted this way. Anyone care to explain? FYI: Only the latest guideline (FY2023) can be found online. The FY2022 version has been removed but I previously downloaded it for keepsake just in case."
"Fraudulent ChatGPT transactions I got a SMS and email from DBS telling me about a blocked transaction on my DBS Visa Debit card. When I checked, it's a US$ 20 transaction to CHATGPT SUBSCRIPTION. This is puzzling since I never used that debit card for any debit card transactions (I only use it as an ATM card). I have several colleagues who got the same thing last week, but their transactions weren't blocked (but was reversed by the bank when they called). When I called DBS to cancel my card, they told me that it's possible they used a random card number generator. But I think it's hard to randomly generate a set of card numbers, expiry dates and CVV accurately. Seems like this problem quite common too, see for example https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/fraudulent-transaction-paid-to-chatgpt-subscription.6901043/page-2https://community.openai.com/t/my-card-was-used-for-chatgpt-subscription-payment-fraud/172663Any idea how did they get our card numbers? Was there some kind of data breach since all the reported cases above seem to be on Visa Debit cards. Also why ChatGPT? Why they want to have so many subscriptions?"

"[TRAY RETURN POLICY] Have you noticed any visible improvements to overall cleanliness post the implementation of this policy? Love the idea of developing civic-mindedness in each and one of us and definitely having everyone (minus the disabled/elderly) return trays after their meal would lessen the burden on the cleaners, theoretically leaving them more time to do other tasks like cleaning the tables. But based on my own observations in the past months, I noticed that tables have gotten dirtier post this policy and am baffled as to why that is? Note: this is not a government bashing piece, so please refrain from doing that. Just wanted some perspective from redditors on this matter, and whether their lived experience is the same as mine."

"This country's mental healthcare system is broken. To be concise, this post will only be about the logistical and practical issues in our mental healthcare system, not sociocultural factors influencing mental well-being in Singapore. I already sent a feedback form to IMH, so this is to update fellow Singaporeans about what the landscape is like.  1. **Public hospital: Uncontactable, no accountability, no patient-doctor relationship**  When you go to emergency services in IMH and their psychiatrist prescribes medication, they do not leave you with contact information for your psychiatrist. I experienced frightening side effects from the medication they gave me and had nobody to contact. The side effects were not mentioned in the information booklet they gave me. I called IMH, they could not trace my psychiatrist, and they told me to call the IMH pharmacy. I called and the person on the line could say nothing more than ""I don't know, anything about your medicine, you need to talk to psychiatrist."" (Like gurl, I know.) What are patients supposed to do if they have bad side effects? Is the only option to go to emergency services again? This lack of a patient-doctor relationship is harmful especially in a medical field that should be defined by continuity of care and an intimate understanding of a patient's mental state.  2. **Public hospital: Absurd waiting list**  The appointment slots they give you are 2‚Äì3 months away. This is unacceptable for people who are in crises or whose mental illnesses are episodic (i.e. people who are usually fine but have moments of great urgency.) A system should be able to accommodate both types of patients‚Äîpatients with chronic but stable illnesses and patients with time-sensitive issues (losing loved ones, suicidal thoughts, etc). Patients who cannot wait to see a psychiatrist will have to look for private care options, which brings me to:  3. **Private care: No information about Medisave-accredited clinics**  There is no information source about where Medisave can be used for mental health treatment outside IMH. There are only articles about how Medisave can be used for psychiatric conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) at public facilities or ""accredited medical institutions"", but no follow-up information about what these accredited medical institutions actually are. I found a clinic with a 2018 website update about how they were Medisave-accredited, only to find out after my appointment with them that they weren't. At this point, I don't even know if ANY private clinics are Medisave-accredited.  4. **Private care: No accessible information about cost**  Most private care websites do not have information about the cost of their services. You can only find out if you call them or if you visit their clinics in person. This is a huge waste of time for everyone involved. A patient should be able to compare prices and make informed choices for their mental healthcare. Psychiatric consultations are not cheap. They can set you back $400 a pop. We really need to know how much they cost before we make a decision.  5. **Online therapy alternative BetterHelp: Inconsistent, veering towards illegitimate**  This is not in our government's purview, but to give you an idea of what an alternative is like, BetterHelp has a dangerously lax definition for what constitutes a ""therapist"". Their ""therapists"" include counsellors without degrees in psychology who practice ""Reiki healing"", hypnosis, or ""crystal therapy"".I understand that we are not entitled to luxurious standards of care with psychiatrists and psychologists at our beck and call, and I understand that sometimes resources are stretched thin in medical infrastructure. What I find unacceptable is that **patients don't even have the information required to make decisions about their treatment**. If they accept that public care is too slow and want to pick a private clinic, they can't tell how much private clinics will cost, and sometimes they're given outdated and inaccurate information. Keep in mind that these patients are, by definition, not doing well mentally, and the more they need care, the harder it will be for them to navigate this confusing medical system. All this will probably be worse for disadvantaged communities, like Singaporeans who don't understand English, or people who don't have the time to do online research."

"Why aren't Micro cars legal in singapore? I've been watching videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYroDMTLVt4) where people talk about the usage of micro cars. They're electric, tiny compared to normal cars, and thus way more efficient than even the most efficient full-size EVs. Why aren't these legal in Singapore? Most of them that I've seen have options for 150ish km ranges, which should be more than sufficient for Singapore commuting, and they're way cheaper than ordinary cars."
"Opinion: The elderly, pregnant and disabled have more entitlement to use ""Priority seats"" than the rest of commuters. Commuters outside these demographics who use these seats do not have the right to doze off/tune out by using earphones. I commute to and from work every day, with a 1 hour journey each way, so I have plenty of experience observing MRT habits and behaviours. For reference, I am in my 20s, so I am young and (relatively) healthy. I have noticed that it is not uncommon to see young people using priority seats, and often listing to music with their earphones in, or falling asleep.In my humble opinion, people outside the 'priority' demographics do not have the right to get too comfortable in these seats, lest they deprive someone more deserving of the seat of the seat. When you sit in a priority seat, you should always be ready to give it up to someone who needs it more.One reasoning many young people, in my generation, use to justifying sitting in one is ""we should remove priority seats, because it gives the elderly/pregnant/disabled a false sense of entitlement"". The purpose of reserved seats is that it places the primary onus upon people sat in those seats to give up their seats to those who need it more. If all reserved seats are filled with people from the 'priority' demographics, the onus would then shift to people seated in other seats. If there were no 'priority' seats, everyone would wait for someone else to give up the seat, which would not work.More often than not, the priority seats tend to be vacant, while other seats are occupied. I, for one, will usually wait for a non-priority seat to be available before I sit down. When I am seated in other, non-priority seats, I expect that young people seated in priority seats should give up their seats, as those seats are the ones that are, first and foremost, earmarked for those who need it. If they do not give up their seats when there is someone who needs it more in front of them, I would tend to give them disapproving glances until they conform to this social expectation. On the rare occasion that I sit down in a priority seat, I do so with the understanding that if someone who needs it more enters the train car I am in, I should make reasonable effort to give up the seat for them.Many of my peers argue, ""its not compulsory"" or ""I paid the same fare as the elderly"". In a similar vein, it is not compulsory to hold the door open for someone who is right behind you when you walk through it. However, if you choose not to do so, you are demonstrating exceptionally poor manners, and it is more than reasonable that you should expect to be chided for your poor manners. Similarly, if you choose to occupy a 'priority seat' and fall asleep/tune out, other commuters have every right to chide you on your lack of manners.TLDR: Priority seats are for those who need it, if you sit in one (and are not from the demographic who needs it), be prepared to give it up at a moments notice.EDIT: This is not a popular opinion and I'm prepared for the downvotes lol. If you disagree, feel free to actually explain what part of my reasoning you disagree with, instead of throwing personal insults :)"

"Reckless Taxi Driver almost caused an accident How are taxi/phv drivers this bad, and constantly getting away with it?This man almost caused an accident just because he couldn't wait a few seconds for the light to turn green, and had the audacity to stare at me when he almost crashed into me.[Happened 24\/05\/2023 \~1845 hours \(ignore the date\/time on camera, something's wrong there\)](https://reddit.com/link/13qk5xe/video/oub6ijnzvr1b1/player)I haven't met any other profession (people doing an activity to make money, not that they can perform it at a high technical level) that's able to consistently get away with how horrendously they do it, and still continue to make a living for themselves.Examples of how bad they are:* As a pedestrian: you can (and should, for your own safety) never take for granted that a taxi/PHV driver saw you, even if you have the right of way. Might be looking at their smartphones taking the next job (flouting traffic rules), or simply expecting you to give way.* As a passenger: their constant abrupt braking/accelerating makes us nauseous (why are they not technically affluent with controlling their vehicle despite doing it for many hours a day bewilders me) . Picking-up/dropping off (esp with grab these days) is a whole separate story, with them not wanting to pick you up/drop you off at certain places, or expecting you to WALK OVER to them when you're already in an accessible place waiting for them to start with. I've had multiple occasions where the taxi meter was already running WHEN I boarded the taxi (booked via grab). For the other private hire modes, there's many occasions where they hit the I've arrived button BEFORE texting me to confirm the exact location. What happened to the grace period?* As a driver: This one's the worst. Driving like they own the roads, beating amber lights, sudden filtering to pick up a passenger, expecting to be given way the moment they turn on their signal lights (if they even do), turning on their signal lights AFTER they start filtering into the lane, driving diagonally towards lane 1 the moment they get on the highway (sometimes dangerously), road hogging obliviously on lane 1, filtering towards the exit from lane 1 in a dangerous manner, NOT giving way to emergency vehicles (or anyone in general), honking at others when they get their way (despite them NOT giving way to start with - they lost the ""battle"") tailgating emergency vehicles to go faster, tailgating, brake checking, submitting fraudulent claims to insurers when involved in an accident etc. Over a decade of driving experience here; I've seen it all.These people really feel like scum. I understand they're doing it for a living but, can they do it properly? I also understand that not everyone's like that, but at this point there's way too many bad sheep out there, especially since the advent of Grab/Uber.Side note, I really think their PHV logos should be luminous (like our triangle P plates for new drivers) so that we're able to easily identify them at night. I personally switch to a more defensive driving style when I notice taxis/phvs right around me.Would definitely like to hear from others regarding your experiences with Taxis/PHVs, good or bad!Edit: realised the video's compressed by reddit again and the light turning green seconds before the encounter is not obvious.Edit 2: people seem to think that one minor mistake according to a ‚Äútheory‚Äù book, when the action is really just out of minimising traffic during peak hours is more worth highlighting than someone cutting in recklessly.

"Silent Carriages in MRT or Buses? Could we have designated silent carriages in buses and MRT trains where it is frowned upon to talk on the phone, chat, or watch videos with the speaker on?"
"Has OTA been effective in improving bus service reliability in Singapore? Inspired by a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13l4by5/singapore_public_transport/) regarding the appeal of Singapore's public transport system (including public buses), I dug deeper into how public bus services are scheduled by the LTA since they took over central bus planning in the early 2010s.***Note:*** *To simplify the technical explanations of specific bus-related terminology, some parts of the post have been generated through ChatGPT.*In 2014, the LTA launched the [Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF)](https://landtransportguru.net/bus-service-reliability-framework/), aimed at improving en-route reliability of bus services. Under the BSRF trial between 2014 & 2016, the reliability of 55 basic bus services were monitored under 2 new indicators:* **Excess Wait Time (EWT):** EWT focuses on minimising the waiting time experienced by passengers at bus stops by measuring the average time passengers wait beyond the scheduled headway (the expected time between two consecutive buses). The goal is to keep the EWT within a certain threshold, typically a few minutes, to ensure that passengers do not face excessive waiting times. It allows for slight variations in bus arrival times, as long as the average wait time remains within the set threshold. This improves the consistency of bus frequencies by reducing the likelihood of long waits between buses.* **On-Time Adherence (OTA):** OTA focuses on ensuring that buses adhere closely to the scheduled arrival and departure times by measuring the percentage of buses that arrive and depart within a specific time window around the scheduled time. The goal is to achieve a high percentage of on-time departures and arrivals, often set at 80% or higher. Thus, it requires buses to closely adhere to the scheduled timetable, minimising variations in arrival and departure times. It aims to provide a more predictable and reliable service for passengers, allowing them to plan their journeys based on the published timetable.Since the start of the [Bus Contracting Model (BCM)](https://landtransportguru.net/bus-infrastructure/bus-contracting-model/) in 2016, **all** basic bus services are required to operate under either EWT or OTA indicators. As of this post, **most** basic bus services operate under the EWT indicator, while a minority of 77 ""low frequency"" bus services operate under OTA, based on a Facebook post by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng in 2019 (Link to the post cannot be shared here due to Reddit restrictions). The quantity of OTA services has changed since then, with the discontinuation of multiple OTA services in 2020 (post-COVID), and the launch of new OTA services (most of which being route variants).1 major downside of bus services under OTA is their potentially longer travelling time, as bus drivers are required to adhere to strict schedules, which means driving slower or laying over at bus stops when they reach too early.Here is the updated list of services running under OTA as of Apr 2023. OTA services can be easily identified by their timetables at their calling bus stops. For SBS Transit and Tower Transit OTA services, their timetables can also be found on their service guides, as well as the SBS Transit app (for SBST services only). **All Express (services starting with 5xx, with suffix ""e"" and ""E"") and City Direct bus services (services starting with 6xx) currently run under OTA. Thus, they'll be excluded from the list below.*** **Operates on OTA daily (including public holidays):** 11, 40, 42, 98M, 115, 127/127A, 143M, 160, 160M, 170, 175, 177, 191, 400, 401, 403, 912\*, 927, 950, 970, 972M, 976, 981* **Operates on OTA on Saturdays only:** 90A, 92/92B, 162/162M, 980* **Operates on OTA on Sundays & Public Holidays only:** 78, 96, 173, 183, 883M, 966* **Operates on OTA on Saturdays, Sundays & Public Holidays only:** 54, 57, 79, 90, 93, 97, 122, 123, 125, 136, 155, 156, 158, 186, 200/200A\*Service 912 (in this instance) refers to the **intra-town** trips that operate on both East loop (towards Admiralty MRT) and West loop (towards Woodlands Train Checkpoint) only. The single loop trips (912A & 912B) currently operate on EWT.With the above background info on BSRF and the EWT/OTA indicators, here are some questions for fellow redditors who frequent public bus services in Singapore (and overseas):1. **Effectiveness:** Did you notice improvements in bus punctuality since the introduction of OTA on selected services? Are buses generally arriving on time as per the schedules?2. **Flexibility vs. Precision:** Do you appreciate the strict adherence to schedules with OTA, or do you feel it limits flexibility for passengers with longer travelling time on buses? Did you encounter situations where buses have left early or missed connections due to strict adherence to the schedule?3. **Efficiency:** In your opinion, has OTA resulted in better utilisation of bus resources and improved service efficiency? Or do you feel there are instances of inefficient operations, such as empty or overcrowded buses?4. **Expansion of OTA to Existing EWT Services:** Given your experience with OTA services (if any), should OTA be extended to more trunk services (i.e. services with frequencies longer than 15 mins, instead of the current standard of 20 mins).5. **Comparison with Overseas Implementation:** For redditors living/who have lived overseas and taken their bus services, are there similar bus reliability indicators implemented by their bus operators/authorities? Are they more effective than the EWT/OTA indicators by LTA, and should Singapore take a page out of overseas bus operators when implementating such indicators?While the above questions mainly focus on OTA, those who have thoughts on the effectiveness of EWT in improving bus service reliability can also share them below."

"How many of you are concerned with AI affecting or 'taking over' your jobs here in Singapore? Since jobs seems to always be a hot topic, and with generative AI now at a level of automation never before seen, I figured it'll be a good time to discuss about it here. For me doing photography, it'll definitely be a concern. Funny enough, I dreamt about having the tech for the longest time to create works of art I have in my head, but never the skill or time to master them. Especially useful for me also when trying to source for content for pitch decks & moodboards, midjourney is very helpful when the images don't exist on Pinterest, or the alternative is photobashing something in photoshop.I had wanted to study concept art drawing prior to apps like midjourney or stable diffusion, mostly because I'm a fan of seeing concept art, but also it'll help me in my own line of work doing commercial and portrait photography with some level of pre-visualisation. Now that the apps are here, I see little point in having to study it, not that I don't find it any less important, but for me personally, the apps fulfilled my own goals without having to fork out the money to study for it so intensively. If I'm in a place and time where I can potentially afford to do so, then sure.I won't deny that what midjourney can create is impressive and scary. Lifelike generated art of people, scenery and products will likely upend certain markets, or create even lesser demand for certain areas. Markets like stock images, corporate portraits (I'm in this as well so it'll affect me), fine art photography (again another area I'm in) and even product photography (there are apps now that can put products on a white backdrop without the need of professional photography equipment) will very likely be disrupted. Why pay more for these particular areas when you can generate it with AI? That will certainly be the direction some will have. The likely last to be affected will probably be events, wedding photography and photojournalism because unless we have another pandemic or some world ending scenario, events will always be happening. People want actual authentic photos of what happened. Of course that isn't gonna stop people from using AI, but probably to fix screw ups like blurry shots, sharpening etc. Beyond that, I could see art markets like artstation, deviantart and countless of online illustrators, voice artists, animators having their careers affected. Concept art painters are only maybe needed for final concept works, and earlier illustrations made with stuff like midjourney. Storyboard artists would probably be one of the most likely career to be most affect imo, because production houses can just generate it in an instant. I know writers will especially be affected by apps like ChatGPT. Companies will probably just have internal editors to just chatgpt articles rather than hire freelance writers for such roles. And also the office jobs as well, probably people in administration roles will be affected, especially when it's simple scheduling of tasks, spreadsheets etc. For me, I will work with it rather than going against it. I know, and know several friends who vehemently deny using AI for their work, that it isn't representative of the artist work. While I don't fully agree, I see where they come from. I've used midjourney to help me with generating moodboards, chatgpt for write ups, and then I'll edit it to become my own content, but I would let people know that they've been used. I would only use it in the context of helping me draft ideas and concepts for me, and never use it to represent my work. I think its a little ridiculous to say 'I've made it!' When really you just made prompts in midjourney. Or perhaps, if it does take over my work, I'll be happy to just change my career to something else. No point arguing, at least in my opinion if something does a better job than I do. Automation in the history of humanity had always  taken and create jobs, so I don't think this would be any different. Better to adapt than to become someone who's jaded and angry about how technology made you redundant (at least imo) Or maybe we'll have a resurgence, with how people still want authentic works of art rather than something machine made. Like how film is making some comeback right now. I guess if it disrupt enough jobs in a capitalist market, some form of UBI will probably emerge. So, what about you? Would like to hear your opinions. Tl;Dr: I am concerned as a photographer who's works may be affected, but I've also used it to help me. If the time comes where it's taken over, I'll move on."
"Getting ~5 scam calls a day for the past weeK Wondering if anyone else is in the same boat as me. For the past week, I've been getting scam/spam calls non-stop since last monday and I have no idea how they got my number. Just yesterday I got 11 calls and i've already gotten 3 today which is really frustrating cause my phone number is being used for work too and these scam calls makes it hard for me to know who are actual customers calling me or not. Cause the scammers are calling from numbers which don't have +65 in front. Curiousity got the better of me and I decided to answer one of them today and not talk at all to see if it really was scam calls or just a persistent survey/marketer. I heard phones ringing and faint conversations in the background, but it seems like the scammer that called me was also keeping quiet like me and ended the call after around 10 secs of this silence.More recently (and less frequently), I started getting whatsapp messages saying ""Hi, is this XX"" and XX is actually my real name and not my whatsapp name which blows my mind cause my phone number and name associated with it is not publicly listed online anywhere (I think so).I tried blocking and reporting numbers, PDPC DNC Registry, Scamshield, etc but they don't seem to work cause I'm still getting bombarded with these calls and messages. I'm guessing my name and number got leaked somewhere and somehow, but I have no idea where or when.Anyone facing this problem as well or anyone managed to stop all these calls?[Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/W8WS7nP) of my call log and whatsapp messagesEdit: My PayNow name is only my surname, so they couldn‚Äôt have gotten my name from there too"

In this case, I also question the decision to destroy a century old community in order to flood the housing market with more units in another west/north backwater area that few locals would favour for accommodation, thereby rendering the entire project moot. I know, because I live in CCK and there are many empty units along the Brickland Road, with a new Tengah estate no one asked for being built just down the way.

Outdated bus stop names Was passing by the other day and saw this oddly named bus stop. Thought it was weird they didn't name it after the nearest blk coz the primary school is quite far away  Was curious why so did a bit of research... Turns out the original stop was located right beside waterway pri and they shifted it some time btw 2021 and 2023 but kept the name  How often does LTA update bus stop names and are there other such examples in SG? Like when they shift a bus stop or when some place gets renamed/redeveloped?

Called my bank and found out my Visa, which never left home, never been charged on, never used for online purchases, etc, was compromised.Becareful everyone, double check your bank accounts if you have debit cards, I was lucky to actually look at this one, since the account is used for bill payments only, I rarely checked it.UOB doesn't seem to care about their customers money, since I bet they'll send me an OTP if it were my UOB one credit card. I am going to cancel all my debit cards, and maybe move my money out of the bank into a safer one. I'm not going to pay $5 for an ATM card to fix the banks mistake.Good night."
"Is it legal to be penalised for rejecting an awarded tenancy? I participated in a tender bid for a unit late 2022 to run a franchise (closing date 29 Nov). The marketing kit for said unit stated that the unit will be available in December 2022 so I bidded a fair amount to get the unit. After almost 6 months (impt), i received notification that i am successful in my bid and am awarded the retail unit.Thing is, in the six months, the franchisor has had a corporate shift and is no longer accepting new franchises. I informed the landlord about this and they said no problem, just try your best to persuade the franchisor. In the meantime, they are preparing the letter of offer and tenancy agreement, and they told me to meet them to receive the documents even though i told them i will likely not proceed with the bid since i am unable to operate the franchise (to propose a new product will require another 6 months of review and approval from landlord).I met the landlord's representative to receive the letter of offer and TA, and asked the franchisor for advice, since in the documents received, it was stated that i will be penalised if i didnt sign and return the documents within 7 days. Franchisor told me to inform the landlord i will have to withdraw from the bid as i will not be awarded the franchise, which i immediately informed on the same day.I recently received an invoice demanding payment for 1 month's rental for thw withdrawal. According to the landlord, it is stated in the bidding document that the bidding offer is valid for 6 months, since i was informed 3 weeks shy of the 6 months that i am awarded the bid, i am liable to pay the penalty. Also, i had apparently failed to accept and return the signed TA and letter of offer, which is another reason for them to charge me the penalty. In the letter of offer, signing it means to accept the offer, whence i had informed the landlord that i am withdrawing on the same day i received the documents!Is it legal for the landlord to charge me the penalty even though i am unable to operate the proposed franchise because of being denied by the franchisor? I hadn't pay the franchise fee because the franchisor wasn't sure i will get the unit and gave up waiting after 3 months.Edit: their asking bid was 2800 and i bidded for 3500"

"Are we paying higher tax rates today in relation to our purchasing power. It‚Äôs the tax time of the year again. And I noticed that rates has not changed in over 10 years (could be even longer). This means that if an income is 50k per annum today. They are paying pretty much the same tax as someone earning 50k per annum 10 years ago. But in todays context, 50k is much less in terms of purchasing power than a decade ago, but yet they are paying the same rate. Meaning to say a person‚Äôs effective tax bracket actually went up. Does the logic check out?"

"Developer ignoring request for key collection and handover of condo Hi Redditporeans,&#x200B;I would like to seek some advice regarding the following matter:1. Parents has bought a condo which TOP at start of June 2023 (final payment has been made)2. Information from developer was to book a date for key collection via iplusliving webapp3. However, the webapp does not allow us to register (specifically cannot register for the condo they bought), hence cannot make booking4. Contacted developer several times with no response from them&#x200B;We are currently stuck in this situation because we are waiting to move into the new condo.

"Urban planners, why does Singapore feel so suburban? Outside of the downtown core, neighborhoods feel mostly residential, with few mixed use zones. Walking around most neighborhoods feel like just passing a bunch of HDB flats, and the occasional hawker center, at least until you reach the mall, which is the vibrant spot of the immediate region. Weather aside, it is not fun or exciting to walk about to explore neighborhoods because there is not much. Notable exceptions are the older districts (eg Little India, Chinatown, etc.)In other cities like Paris, London, or New York, there is a lot more mixed use zoning, and restaurants, bars, coffee shops, cultural amenities, etc seem to be more uniformly distributed across the city. Those cities are very walkable and there is life on every street because buildings are mixed use.I don‚Äôt have a background in urban planning so I‚Äôm wondering if my observations are accurate, and whether there is an explanation for this."

An Assessment of the Ministerial Review on the Ridout Bungalow Leases A pretty erudite analysis of the saga following the CPIB and ministerial reviews.
"Going overseas to seek inpatient mental health treatment? (working,studying,holiday,medical tourism?) Actually this topic has been on my mind for quite some time. It's because I have harboured thoughts of working/studying overseas - but one point that my pdoc has brought up is always the lack of social support/how I can rely on my parents in SG(which I find is utter rubbish as my parents don't provide much emotional support and getting hospitalised in IMH in a crisis really sucks)But can this be mitigated with good insurance? I remember that I wanted to go overseas for my final sem at my private uni, and they told me about comprehensive health coverage, including medical repatriation in case of emergency.Yes, in the USA/UK, they have funding cuts, people thrown into prison instead of mental hospitals, too few mental hospitals for people, long waiting times and yada yada. But you have multiple hospitals for mental health, and it's not centralised like IMH and some other wards in general restructured hospitals - so you can probably choose a hospital instead of being warded in IMH c-class wards against your will.I mean IMH is pretty shit for inpatient hospitalisation, and I know peers with BPD who were kicked out from the more conducive Mood Disorders Unit(MDU). Plus, each person may spend 1 month in MDU, making it hard for other people to use the facilities.Also in Australia, you have short-term crisis centres where you can rest there and recuperate instead of going to a hospital.I digress, looking at Britney Spears, I believe due to her A-list status and her being rich, she would never be thrown into one of those third-rate psychiatric hospitals in the USA. Probably UCLA or somewhere conducive for recovery. I guess it's the same for rich people anywhere in the world. They can probably check themselves into Mount E, but if you get sent into IMH, good luck.Digressing further from this topic,some people with chronic mental health illnesses have benefitted from a month's sabbatical overseas, ie. homestays or backpacking trips.So I would like to hear your thoughts, whether you are a healthcare professional, or a person seeking mental health treatment on how feasible/unfeasible is it to seek mental health treatment overseas esp when you are working/studying overseas. Or perhaps medical tourism etc? Or if you are there on a holiday and happened to relapse?This is probably quite a touchy topic. I mean, some may argue that at least having beds in IMH helps to ensure that lives are saved, instead of people becoming homeless/people committing suicide/going to jail aka USA. But then again, some may argue about the right-to-live/right-to-die and how people overseas have more freedom of choice.For me, based on my personal experience, my stays in the C-class wards have been so traumatising that I would prefer not to be saved. I have had recurring dreams in the past where I was hallucinating/going out of control and the ambulance sent me to IMH. Some dreams were super peculiar, ie. sitting on a yoga mat in a dance hall, ie. strapped to a stretcher and staring out of the window with nothing to do. The theme is always about having nothing to do.I know there's the Short Stay Unit and they are trying to improve their services and all, but I am not sure if they have the budget/infrastructure to really revamp majority of the wards? You can argue about why there's no specialised ward for personality disorders also since they would benefit the most from therapy and less of medicine - more and more people are getting diagnosed with BPD every year and the incidence is catching up with depression. (Maybe some commentators might try to armchair diagnose me based on this statement) Or you can argue that only a small majority of people benefit from MDU/EPIP so far.TL;DR; Going overseas to seek mental health treatment(inpatient) as a skilled worker, as a student or as a tourist with a relapse or even maybe medical tourism - is it feasible? What are the barriers?Ps. I stayed in Sayang wellness before and NUH. Would rather be in a c class ward/b2 ward with decent facilities to save money. People stayed in Sayang for one month ended up spending 10k. I was only there for 7 days, thank God. and Sayang only for stable patients, heard Mount E is even more ex than Sayang but ok with suicidal pts. I also visited people on mdu before. Tbh I rather be warded for a physical condition in c class ward than imh acute c class ward. At least I can use the phone n I won't be shuffled back and forth. And maybe they will give me opiates or painkillers to make me drowsy instead of being alert and restless af. I have stayed in the holding area in general hospitals due to medical complications for suicide attempt and I prefer that experience prior to ambulance transfer. The ambulance transfer really fucks with you. You think u are going somewhere nice but reality hits. So when ppl talk about going c class for physical illness if no insurance rider etc, I call bullshit on this one. No air con won't die, but IMH c class ward really fucks with you. I wrote in to assoc prof Chua when he was CEO of IMH to complain, but once you go in, you are at their mercy.It's crazy how therapeutic having my Paimon doll, other dolls,stuffed toys and Netflix/games is. Escapism at its finest."

"Why neighbour dispute is still not being talked in parliament? The Ridout saga left a bad taste for me. While some guy gets to live comfortably, many citizens don't get to have the same privileges. Especially when there's neighbour dispute.The saga came about few months ago and it got immediate attention in parliament. Whereas for any neighbour dispute, agencies just keep bouncing back and forth with no talk in parliament.When exactly can we have a talk on neighbour disputes in parliament?Why people get away for deliberate attack, property damages or deliberate noise pollution?  Search online or any Facebook group, a ton of videos on neighbours being a-hole. So when can parliament talk and start talking about nuisance at home?"

"Opinion: Road accidents are as much the driver‚Äôs fault as they are the road designer‚Äôs I read this take in a book on car dependency/centricity and I couldn‚Äôt help but keep thinking about it in light of the recent spate of vehicular accidents causing serious injuries/death.Yes, a portion of blame must lie on the operator of the vehicle, for speeding, for driving recklessly, for being under the influence, etc.But it‚Äôs well documented that drivers drive as fast as they feel safe to. This is why the US has such a high rate of road injuries/death - in the early days, planners believe that building wide straight roads in non-highway use cases (stroads) will reduce the room for error and make it safer. But such accommodating road designs just encourage faster driving which result in higher fatalities.Singapore has plenty of stroads. Upper Thompson Road, Sims Ave, Yio Chu Kang Road, Upper Serangoon Road, etc. They are so easy to speed on because they are so accommodating to cars. It‚Äôs such a shame because Sims Ave and Upper Serangoon Road could have been such interesting streets, lined with shophouses, but instead they are human-hostile stroads with 4(?) lanes of traffic and tiny narrow sidewalks.Hypothetically, if our roads looked more like central London‚Äôs, or Manhattan‚Äôs, we would probably have a lot fewer accidents and casualties, because the roads inherently discourage speeding. How do you speed when the road is narrow, twisty, and short? I‚Äôm not saying we should replicate London‚Äôs roads, but this is a trade off that is worth considering. How much more do we want to accommodate a minority of the population by making it easy to drive fast at the expense of other road users and pedestrians?"

"What should be done about Singapore‚Äôs HDB system? We‚Äôve all heard by now CSJ‚Äôs famous rants against the ruling party and the HDB Leasehold system. And the recent public and private housing pricing crisis plus the fact that public housing flats are aging is exacerbating the sentiment that perhaps Leasehold is headed towards a ‚Äòdoomsday‚Äô scenario when the older flats completely age out. I‚Äôve seen CSJ‚Äôs arguments but tbh am very unimpressed. It just seems to rant nonstop and offers no feasible alternatives whatsoever other than to fling around loads of ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù.So let‚Äôs just get a mini-discussion going here: what should be done otherwise or how should we change the way public housing is handled in Singapore? Keep in mind that land is finite, and in short supply here.Thoughts?My own take on this:1) Artificially deflate and control public housing pricing based off current inflation rates (for eg) and force existing public housing out of the speculation of private market. Based on geographic locations, set price ceilings for public housing. In fact, we already do this for new BTOs by setting the guide price before purchase. We just need to extend this to the resale market.  **Public housing was NEVER supposed to be a speculative asset. End of story.** 2) Related to point 1), Increase MOP for PLH BTOs to 20 years. You like the prime area right? Make sure you willing to stay ultra long-term.3) Introduce more concrete private housing cooling measures to ensure foreigners don‚Äôt buy up our residential areas (recent announcement might count but more can be done).4) Buyout close to aged out HDB plots at discounted or equal to fair market value to build new BTO plots. In essence we ‚Äòrecycle‚Äô aged out HDB plots without screwing over the plot‚Äôs owners since (see point 1) public housing pricing is controlled, they could always buy elsewhere w the buyout money."

In light of the death of SGT Raja alleged to be due to a toxic SPF working environment, I felt that I have to post this to let people know my experiences in SPF.  I am writing under an alias account to protect my identity. Let‚Äôs see if SPF would doxx me, in hypocrisy to their own laws.  This is a story about a broken employee grievance system, written to warn those considering joining this organization. This is my story of my experience in SPF. No names or sensitive information is shared in adherence to Official Secrets Act.  Whilst I was being posted to investigation branch, another department‚Äôs IOs warned me about the department I was being posted to. They talked about the toxic people and manager there. At that time, I didn't believe them.  As my police tours started, as seen on CNA documentary, I was in charge of handling phone calls on cases from NPCOs. My teammates would work on other tasks.  Going in fresh, I did not know what to expect. I asked my allocated mentor what I should look out for when picking up calls. He said, ‚Äòwhen you become more experienced you will know.‚Äô Later on, I asked if he could demonstrate how to handle the phone calls, he picked up one and demonstrated how fast he could handle a call and ended the call within 20s. There was no explanation that came after. This would be his modus operandi for many of his future 'teachings'. With this, I went on tours without the basic explanations on what I should be doing even when I asked.  During the course of my tours, I tried to ask my teammates on the tasks and cases, but many denied to share information and told me to ask my mentor instead. People were not forthcoming in sharing knowledge ‚Äì Knowledge that was essential to do my job.  In addition, there was no proper orientation. Every time I needed a document or resource to do my work, I had to go beg around for them. In contrast, other departments have starter packs with documents to get them started. Their teammates were forthcoming in sharing. I envied them.  As I naively believed that the phone calls were about speed, including making decisions as my mentor had demonstrated so, I tried to pick up all the phones calls that came during tour. As a result, I was overwhelmed.  I only found out much later that my teammates were supposed to help pick up the calls. But sadly, they did not inform me or offer to help. They certainly did not notice something was amiss when they were getting little to no calls. As a result, I was making mistakes in my work. I kept forgetting stuff as I got overwhelmed by calls during tours and outside tours.  As I made work mistakes during tour, some of my teammates began to say: ‚Äòif you don't know something, you must ask‚Äô. In my thoughts, I was thinking, I did ask but I get bounced around or get nonchalant answers except from a few people. This is just my bias, but I think in the private sector, people would know better. They would know that those with experience have to also play their part to share.  The repercussions are that during tour, I made some decisions and some did not work out. I then get blamed for them. Generally, there was a stance that did not tolerate mistake ‚Äì which one can argue to be both good and bad.  I raised the issue on my mentor to my manager. I told her in a nice manner that my mentor was not really teaching me the things I needed. Based on my impression, my manager talked to my mentor to take corrective action. At first, things seemed to get better, because my mentor would sit down with me to explain a subject that was essential for my work. However, this only happened once. The nonchalant teaching continued afterwards. If I did not ask, nothing is ever shared or taught. But to be fair to the manager, she did try to share some teachings. Am I supposed to know what to ask when the information is something that is privileged to those with experience? Work mistakes continued. With the overload in work, I continued to make mistakes during work, including typos. I was also blamed for not coping well.  Thankfully, there was a teammate who was kind enough to share the resources that his own mentor shared with him. If not, I could not even do my basic work.  However, as my work performance was not improving, my manager became more and more abusive. She became fiercer and fiercer in her interactions with me, sometimes shouting my name fiercely out from her room. Months later, she would also fiercely tell me to get out of her room and to leave her department. Hostile interactions continued as she gave a ‚Äòblack‚Äô face during our interactions, including when I greeted her in the morning. (The boss made all sorts of micro-aggressions too, not like she recognize them)  At some point, the narrative that I did not ask has become entrenched, even though 9 out of 10 times I can assuredly, based on my conscience, say that I did. I asked to the best of what I could, without the privileged information held by the mentors. (I was even blamed later for asking about everything. Just how self-serving can these people get?) Later on, I found out that my mentor was covering his ass by speaking poorly about me to my manager. Given that she is, in my opinion, a Machiavellian covert vulnerable narcissist who cannot take disagreement, it was clear that he was agreeing with her own views on my incompetence to protect his position.  One month in, I sat with my big boss to tell him that I wanted to change department. He dismissed my concerns, showing a lack of interest.  The next day, when I was back in the office, I was shocked when my boss angrily told me off for talking bad about her to the boss behind her back. Since when did sharing concerns about a manager become bad talking? That was when I knew that what I told my big boss was being conveyed to my manager. I still remember her saying fiercely: ‚ÄúI hate people who talk bad about me behind my back the most!‚Äù Given the fierce backlash from trying to raise an issue, one would be mad to raise issues to the big boss.  So I tolerated such a department. A few months in, when I finally found out that I was not supposed to take all the calls from NPCOs during AIO tour and told my manager, she blamed me for not asking. This blaming continued even though she said at the start with such gusto to me that there will be no blaming in this department, after making negative assumptions that I was blaming someone for a case that was passed down to me, that was not done well.  Deteriorating treatments continued, and my mental health deteriorated. I was getting dark thoughts. I sat down with my big boss while censoring my words on my manager and I was referred to PPSD for therapy. I knew this had to be done because I knew something would happen if I did not leave this department.  This time, it was my big boss who said, ‚Äòwhy didn't you tell me?‚Äô In my mind, I was thinking, you were conveying what I said to my boss, and it only leads to blaming and scolding. You think I would be able to tell you? I would only be shooting myself in the leg.  Nine months in, I was finally transferred to another department. I ceased my therapy then as the colleagues there were friendly, professional, and forthcoming with their sharing and I was able to do my work well. Some of the work is even more advanced than my previous work. At one point, I handed in a file that was well done to my big boss. There, he asked me, ‚Äòwhy is it that you couldn‚Äôt cope previously?‚Äô That was when I could confirm, he didn‚Äôt really care.  Whilst I was in the new department, the commander held a no supervisor chat with the employees. Before I went to the talk, I was clearly told to send the minutes of that chat to a supervisor, who was not supposed to be there. Ultimately, I did not send those minutes out to the unauthorized supervisor. But at the same time, I could not raise my issue or give my true feelings about the organization to the commander as that information could be leaked. I am sure my colleagues felt the same, given their lackluster response.  Ultimately, I decided to quit SPF, given how dysfunctional the organization was. There was no procedural justice or any effective form of grievance handling of verbally abusive managers.  One year later, I still get dark thoughts. During one such attack, I wrote in to a minister to look into the matter. Action was finally taken. Info was sent to the division‚Äôs feedback and IAO called me. I thought something was finally getting done. I thought that someone was finally going to recognize that there was a problem here.  What happened during the interview was not pretty. I felt that the Internal Affairs Officer had deemed me to be a troublemaker, saying that he knew that the big boss had engaged me on the matter even though I said that he did not. However, in truth, my discussion with the big boss on that matter in the entire nine months did not exceed ten lines. Okay, maybe twenty lines just to be generous. He told me that the big boss did a lot of things for me behind the scenes and asked if I know what had been done for me. I told him that I did not know what actions had been taken. This was my honest perspective as the management only communicated within themselves. Nothing was ever shared with me. No one informed if action was taken against my manager. No one engaged me to ask me more about the problem that I faced in my department. If they did engage anyone, I can only speculate that they talked to my manager. Weird isn‚Äôt it? When someone raise an issue, they do not try to learn more about the issue from the person raising the issue, but talk to the manager and ask her opinion on the person raising the issue. What kind of organization does not ensure the anonymity of the persons raising issues?  The internal affairs officer asked why I did not seek counseling or treatment after. I told him I was doing alright in the new department. I was also thinking: ‚Äòafter I left, I didn‚Äôt, because I would have to pay for my own counseling and I was not employed for a year already.‚Äô During this year, I fought hard against my dark thoughts using self-help cognitive therapy.  After a year of investigations, the internal affairs officer called me and said that they did not find my boss‚Äô behavior to be excessive. This was verbatim. I told him that some of the people I know had left SPF ‚Äì people whom I know were in the new department which the manager took over. He told me that people were leaving en masse from the public service not just SPF.  So, instead of trying to fix the problem, SPF buried it and condoned it? That is what I thought.  Given how negative the initial portions of the interview were by the internal affairs officer, I could only speculate how SPF processed my provided information when the minister forwarded the information to the feedback department of the police. I speculate that my division and my manager got hold of the information first, gathered information from people in my ex-department. If that was the case, how could the investigation and information gathered not be biased? The manager herself would be exerting pressure on those providing information. The same goes when the IAO officer was interviewing witnesses. Did the witnesses have to provide leave of absence with supervisors, and was there any pressure exerted onto them to be politically correct, given that the manager has rank and position?  And this concludes my story. I am trying to move on with life, trying to find positive interpretations of growth and peace to my dark thoughts and all the gaslighting. I considered suing SPF but it would take a toll on me financially, emotionally, and mentally.  I am writing this post because I believe people need to know what they are getting into when they sign that contract with SPF. They need to know that some parts of SPF are rotten and that one may experience a department and division that do not care about the mental wellbeing or the procedural justice that pertains to employee grievance. These structures may exist on paper, but are sorely lacking in reality. SPF would surely disagree given how well the persons involved can cover their asses.  I would like to end off by asking people who are looking to join SPF, not to believe my words at face value because this story is just my perspective, but to think critically for themselves, talk to friends who left SPF and see what their experiences are. Not just look at the rosy pictures painted by yearly advertisements. Be sure to give careful consideration to the monetary bond for those who sign on.  With all that is said, my conscience is clear. I have been blamed for not being resilient, not coping with my work, being unsuitable for being an IO, and having poor job fit, but I know better. I produced high quality work on complex cases that was recognized by my colleagues and manager at my new department, thanks to proper mentoring in the new department. I know better than to be gaslighted.  All that I have posted here are my personal perspectives. I am sure SPF would vehemently disagree given that the letter they sent me (portions attached below) had disavowed all legitimacy of my claims. After all, despite providing some evidence on chat, they have found ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô to substantiate my allegations.  Now, after two years of fighting my inner demons, I am taking a short course, with many thanks to skills future (kudos to the government on that) to pivot industry. I hope that everyone would be able to find workplaces that are not abusive and workplaces with functional employee grievance systems.  I am merely sharing my story because I believe people deserve to know. Be careful joining an organization that is so good at managing impressions. If they can with their conscience look at me and say that there are no problems, then so be it. The symptoms are all there. I fully empathize with the experiences of SGT Raja because I have experienced similar dysfunctional management where the big boss sides with the boss and there is no form of effective grievance handling in the force. There is no form of 3rd party investigation or whistleblowing within. You raise an issue against your colleague, your colleague will know. You raise an issue against your boss, your boss will know. They will then beat you down like they have done so towards me, like during the initial portions of the IAO investigation. Own self check own self. This is the consequences. If you are thinking that this story sounds ludicrous, I am thinking the same.  IAO officer got the guts to say to me on the phone that his investigations revealed that the manager‚Äôs treatment of me was not excessive and that SPF was losing a lot of people just like the other parts of public service, but got no courage to put it down on the reply he sent me. I can only conclude that the investigation was slipshod, biased towards the manager and never really finding out why I couldn‚Äôt cope. I can speculate that all sorts of problems are buried in this manner. I challenge SPF to send my investigation file and SGT Raja's for audit by a truly independent body, or even better, open those documents up for public scrutiny."

In light of the death of SGT Raja alleged to be due to a toxic SPF working environment, I felt that I have to post this to let people know my experiences in SPF.I am writing under an alias account to protect my identity. Let‚Äôs see if SPF would doxx me, in hypocrisy to their own laws.This is a story about a broken employee grievance system, written to warn those considering joining this organization. This is my story of my experience in SPF. No names or sensitive information is shared in adherence to Official Secrets Act.Whilst I was being posted to investigation branch, another department‚Äôs IOs warned me about the department I was being posted to. They talked about the toxic people and manager there. At that time, I didn't believe them.As my police tours started, as seen on CNA documentary, I was in charge of handling phone calls on cases from NPCOs. My teammates would work on other tasks.Going in fresh, I did not know what to expect. I asked my allocated mentor what I should look out for when picking up calls. He said, ‚Äòwhen you become more experienced you will know.‚Äô Later on, I asked if he could demonstrate how to handle the phone calls, he picked up one and demonstrated how fast he could handle a call and ended the call within 20s. There was no explanation that came after. This would be his modus operandi for many of his future 'teachings'. With this, I went on tours without the basic explanations on what I should be doing even when I asked.During the course of my tours, I tried to ask my teammates on the tasks and cases, but many denied to share information and told me to ask my mentor instead. People were not forthcoming in sharing knowledge ‚Äì Knowledge that was essential to do my job.In addition, there was no proper orientation. Every time I needed a document or resource to do my work, I had to go beg around for them. In contrast, other departments have starter packs with documents to get them started. Their teammates were forthcoming in sharing. I envied them.As I naively believed that the phone calls were about speed, including making decisions as my mentor had demonstrated so, I tried to pick up all the phones calls that came during tour. As a result, I was overwhelmed.I only found out much later that my teammates were supposed to help pick up the calls. But sadly, they did not inform me or offer to help. They certainly did not notice something was amiss when they were getting little to no calls. As a result, I was making mistakes in my work. I kept forgetting stuff as I got overwhelmed by calls during tours and outside tours.As I made work mistakes during tour, some of my teammates began to say: ‚Äòif you don't know something, you must ask‚Äô. In my thoughts, I was thinking, I did ask but I get bounced around or get nonchalant answers except from a few people. This is just my bias, but I think in the private sector, people would know better. They would know that those with experience have to also play their part to share.The repercussions are that during tour, I made some decisions and some did not work out. I then get blamed for them. Generally, there was a stance that did not tolerate mistake ‚Äì which one can argue to be both good and bad.I raised the issue on my mentor to my manager. I told her in a nice manner that my mentor was not really teaching me the things I needed. Based on my impression, my manager talked to my mentor to take corrective action. At first, things seemed to get better, because my mentor would sit down with me to explain a subject that was essential for my work. However, this only happened once. The nonchalant teaching continued afterwards. If I did not ask, nothing is ever shared or taught. But to be fair to the manager, she did try to share some teachings. Am I supposed to know what to ask when the information is something that is privileged to those with experience? Work mistakes continued. With the overload in work, I continued to make mistakes during work, including typos. I was also blamed for not coping well.Thankfully, there was a teammate who was kind enough to share the resources that his own mentor shared with him. If not, I could not even do my basic work.However, as my work performance was not improving, my manager became more and more abusive. She became fiercer and fiercer in her interactions with me, sometimes shouting my name fiercely out from her room. Months later, she would also fiercely tell me to get out of her room and to leave her department. Hostile interactions continued as she gave a ‚Äòblack‚Äô face during our interactions, including when I greeted her in the morning. (The boss made all sorts of micro-aggressions too, not like she recognize them)At some point, the narrative that I did not ask has become entrenched, even though 9 out of 10 times I can assuredly, based on my conscience, say that I did. I asked to the best of what I could, without the privileged information held by the mentors. (I was even blamed later for asking about everything. Just how self-serving can these people get?) Later on, I found out that my mentor was covering his ass by speaking poorly about me to my manager. Given that she is, in my opinion, a Machiavellian covert vulnerable narcissist who cannot take disagreement, it was clear that he was agreeing with her own views on my incompetence to protect his position.One month in, I sat with my big boss to tell him that I wanted to change department. He dismissed my concerns, showing a lack of interest.The next day, when I was back in the office, I was shocked when my boss angrily told me off for talking bad about her to the boss behind her back. Since when did sharing concerns about a manager become bad talking? That was when I knew that what I told my big boss was being conveyed to my manager. I still remember her saying fiercely: ‚ÄúI hate people who talk bad about me behind my back the most!‚Äù Given the fierce backlash from trying to raise an issue, one would be mad to raise issues to the big boss.So I tolerated such a department. A few months in, when I finally found out that I was not supposed to take all the calls from NPCOs during AIO tour and told my manager, she blamed me for not asking.

"Since this is topical: Bus lanes should be 24/7 Singapore has 3 different types of bus-lanes: peak hour, full-day (which excludes nights and sundays), and bus-only which are in force 24/7. I think bus-only makes a lot more sense:- If there's congestion, then buses should be given priority- If there isn't any congestion, then other vehicles don't need the extra lane anywaywhich is simple reasoning for this. The main benefit of bus-only lanes over peak-hour lanes is that they help buses pull out of bus bays. Even if the road isn't heavily congested, when there's a mild stream of traffic, buses still have to wait in the bay for a chance to pull out. Our buses spend a lot of time stopping so it's important to cut down on dwell times.In fact, in bus lanes it makes more sense to build in-lane bus stops (i.e. buses stop directly in the lane) rather than bus bays, but most of our bus lane routes still have bus bays. Rebuilding bus stops is expensive but painting lanes red is cheap, so an interim measure to help buses pull out of bays is to make the lane bus-only.The difference between full-day bus lanes and bus-only lanes isn't as big, but I don't see any point in having big signs stating stating full-day hours when you can just say ""buses only"" and call it a day."

"PSA - Job Scam (V2) Modus Operandi I'm sure most of you have come across news involving scammers stealing banking credentials by tricking victims to download malicious apps, as well as job scams where scammers get victims to pay the scammers money in return for more money. I've recently come across a new scam which combines both, putting it here to spread awareness. BTW I do not recommend engaging with scammers, but I do it sometimes when I'm bored. So today, I received an unsolicited job advertisement on , advertising for drivers, cleaners, etc with decent salaries (around $3-4k a month for a 9-5 job, 5 days a week). The scammer asked me to choose which job I want, and said they will forward my contact to her boss. Shortly afterwards, someone texted me on Telegram claiming he is from some recruitment agency, following up on my job application. To sign up for the job, he gave me a Google drive URL with an .apk file for me to download, and promised a $10 reward when I install the app. He claims that the app cannot be uploaded on Google Play as it's a new app still in testing phase. I uploaded the file on virustotal, here's the result https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7cd29e47f24a558b1330d76d816c93388b329c9bce46f456745a23e33b8216f0?nocache=1Some quick googling on the detected malwares reveals that it's probably something that can record my keyboard inputs and intercept my OTPs.

Foreign workers sleeping overnight outdoors next to their worksite I noticed a few workers sleeping on yoga mats overnight for the past few nights. They would wake up at 7am when their supervisors arrive. Is this a new trend to avoid transporting workers in lorries? Letting them sleep next to their workplace?

"NUH now appears to be charging for home delivery of medicines With COVID, they used to do free delivery of medicines once a month (or something like that). I was just told they are now charging a flat fee of $8 unless your order exceeds the value of $200 (starting from April onwards).That might explain why the pharmacy is so packed these days...I guess the COVID risk has lowered enough that they dont feel the need to minimize people at the pharmacy anymore."
"PAP policies and generational unfairness Let's take the new BTO housing model. It's a step in the right direction for the future. But my question is, doesn't it exacerbate inequalities between existing homeowners (whose govt subsidised flats are going to become rare and even more expensive commodities) and future homeowners (whose flats will be under the new scheme)? Why isn't the government doing anything about the existing homeowners who played the system to win a lottery prize? Instead, having acknowledged some of the deep unfairness in the system, the government has decided that only future homeowners will be subject to this new scheme which is meant to mitigate the lottery effect.In my opinion, the PAP's new policies are going to drive an increasingly bigger gulf between the haves and the have nots. The past generations who benefitted the most from the housing policies are going to continue to reap those benefits, at the expense of young people who find that housing have reached unaffordable levels and whose flats may never fetch the same kind of resale value as their seniors' or parents' flats. It's not just the housing policy. Another example that comes to mind is the working mother's child relief. This tax relief was substantially slashed for mothers earning more than 5k a month in Budget 2023 - oh but it only applies to mothers who give birth from 2024 onwards. These mothers are largely going to belong to the younger generation - the ones whose flats will likely be under the new BTO system too. Meanwhile, existing mums who are not planning to have any more kids continue to enjoy exponentially higher tax relief than new mums.So if you're a young person who doesn't have a flat or kids yet, you're really a lot worse off than those who came before you. If you get a Prime or Plus BTO flat, you will face a ton more resale conditions than those who bought their flats under the old schemes. Their flats will continue to appreciate. You will face difficulties selling your flat in the future that they never will. Meanwhile, you or your wife will be paying significantly higher income tax than them, assuming your / her income exceeds 5k a month.In essence, the have nots keep paying a higher and higher price. The haves are blissfully untouched or even benefit from the new policies. Is this fair?"
"What if we could buy resale HDBs at cost price, without affecting the resale market? The idea came about as I was looking at resale prices being 2 to 3 times the BTO price of recently MOPed estates. I was not ready to sacrifice this much liquidity into a house, one in which I most likely will want to stay in forever and not looking to flip. As a result, I felt the amount of money I use to buy the house is seen as a sunk cost. I thought to myself, what if there was a scheme to buy resale HDBs that allows buyers who **do not intend to resell their houses for profit** to get a flat at near BTO cost price but more importantly should not affect existing homeowner's resale prices and demand.With the recent Standard, Plus and Prime categories, I call this scheme the HDB Lite scheme.To start off, both buyer and seller must let the HDB act as the middleman for the transaction.### Purchase of Lite flats1. Seller approaches HDB to sell back the flat at resale value. This resale value is determined by HDB and will of course be lower than reselling on the private market but the variance shouldn't be too high. Seller is **not subject to resale levy**. This is the incentive for sellers.1. HDB will post a listing of the flat. The flat's value reverts to its BTO price, adjusted for depreciation and inflation which is again determined by HDB.1. Buyer decides to buy the flat. Now here are the conditions for a home buyer under this scheme (let's call it HDB Lite)  1. MOP is forever.  1. Only room rental is allowed, and rental cost is determined by HDB based on market rate. HDB takes a cut of the rental, and balance of which is credited into CPF.  1. 20% downpayment required, of which all of it must be in cash. No full payments, no early repayment.  1. Loan is required, and will be at a higher interest rate than your standard HDB loan of 2.6%. This is because HDB initially takes a loss due to buying the flat at resale value.  1. Buyer and their partner must be registered with a 50:50 ownership. This is to prevent the spouse from purchasing another property while under benefits of the Lite scheme.The reason for the conditions is to allow HDB to claw back its loss from purchasing the flat from the seller via interest rates. My idea is not perfect, as it does not account for a lot of edge cases that would make HDB and thereby the taxpayer the losing party in this transaction.### For the resale of Lite flats.For selling of Lite flats, they can remain as Lite flats or converted to Standard flats. The seller under this Lite scheme will only be able to sell their flats to others via HDB. #### Lite-to-Lite  1. The seller must at the same time purchase another house to stay in via HDB Contra Facility. The new house can be a Standard HDB.  1. Upon selling, all proceeds are immediately deposited into CPF. No cash. This is to prevent sellers from using this Lite scheme as a means to speculate and profit. The idea of this scheme is to provide affordable housing, not for investment.  1. The flat's value reverts to its BTO price, adjusted for depreciation and inflation.  1. Any renovation or upgrade works done by the seller is taken into account, and increases the value of the house **up to a ceiling**.  1. Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay the outstanding loan of the seller first, with an early repayment penalty.#### For Lite-to-Standard sales:1. The seller under this Lite scheme will only be able to sell their flats to others via HDB.  1. Same, must utilize HDB Contra Facility to ensure you have a place to stay  1. Flat value is assessed to be at the private resale market rate, based on HDB's valuation. Of course, this only applies to the buyer's point of view. From the seller's POV, same as selling from Lite-to-Lite.  1. Any renovation or upgrade works done by the seller is taken into account, and increases the value of the house  1. Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay the outstanding loan of the seller first, however there is **no early repayment penalty** to incentivize selling to a Standard buyer and not lock up the supply of flats### Upgrading from Lite to StandardWhat if the homeowner decides to treat his existing home as an asset for flipping or to hand it down to his children? There is an avenue, again with tons of caveats.    1. The flat must first be ""sold"" at a Lite valuation.  1. The flat is then assessed based on private resale market rate, based on HDB's valuation.  1. Renovation or upgrade works will not be taken into account for valuation of the flat  1. The Lite sale proceeds are immediately used to fund the Standard purchase. No early repayment penalty. You are essentially rebuying your existing house, except now it has no more restrictions  1. Sales incur a resale levy, and the new flat's downpayment must be financed through HDB loan. This time, full payment is allowed but subject to penalties.The ideas and figures/percentages are just a rough gauges on what I thought would allow this scheme to work. I am definitely biased as a buyer looking to purchase a resale flat, so let me know your thoughts."
"Is it any wonder that children in Singapore are stressed AF? I got forwarded this screenshot and having left the education system for many years, I am amazed at what parents aim for nowadays.

"Funerals should be held at designated areas, not void decks Just about had enough of how loud they had become over the past few years and disrupting life in HDB areas.

Please just have funerals at designated places like how Korea does it."

Kindergarten abuse case I hope spf does something. This is terrible and troubling to watch
"Tomorrow is Cooling-off Day. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about ECDA‚Äôs response to the Kinderland case. Yes, I know that the President has no policymaking power, and the PAP doesn‚Äôt want us to conflate the issues at the ballot box. But as much as they want us to compartmentalise away the inconvenient things, as a citizen and parent of a young child I cannot compartmentalise my unease with the general state of affairs. I will admit that it might influence my vote.I consider myself an intelligent and rational voter. I know which issues belong in which bucket and how not to conflate them. I am also not a single-issue voter. But the Kinderland case and ECDA‚Äôs almost-casual response to has hung over me these couple of days. In short, it makes my blood boil that the abuser was not at least ordered to take a leave of absence during ECDA‚Äôs investigation.Here‚Äôs CNA‚Äôs timeline of events ([https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-teacher-charged-child-abuse-timeline-3734046](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-teacher-charged-child-abuse-timeline-3734046)):* **Aug 10:** ECDA launched its investigation after being alerted to the incidents by ""a former employee"". It did not say who the former employee was.* **Aug 17:** Kinderland said it was made aware of the videos when it was contacted by ECDA on Aug 17. Three staff members of the Woodlands Mart centre met ECDA and were shown the videos.* **Aug 18:** Another Kinderland staff member met ECDA and was shown the videos.* Kinderland headquarters started a disciplinary inquiry and met with Lin. The principal of Woodlands Mart and Lin contacted the parents of the affected children.* **Aug 28:** Videos emerge on social media of the incidents at Woodlands Mart preschool. Lin was arrested and [she was fired](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-mart-alleged-abuse-videos-teacher-spf-ecda-3729716).From the above facts, we can safely surmise the following:* ECDA had seen the videos at least as early as 17 Aug, if not 10 Aug. * The preschool teacher was only fired on 28 Aug. Whether it was at ECDA‚Äôs behest, we do not know. But what we do know is that ECDA has the power to bar a teacher from the preschool sector, which they had done earlier today.* Based on the timeline, no new material evidence had surfaced between 17 Aug and today. Neither does the timeline suggest that ECDA had concluded its investigation by today.* Chronologically, this means that ECDA barred the teacher only after the public uproar emerged. We do not know whether they would have done so anyway. But these are the optics.At the minimum, this means that someone at ECDA had seen the videos on 17 Aug or 10 Aug and still allowed the abuser to continue working as usual for the past 2 weeks or so.It baffles me that the abuser was not put on a leave of absence during the investigation. After all, there is very recent precedence for this at the very top of the government. The following questions have to be asked:* Does ECDA suffer from a worrying lack of urgency or empathy for the plight of small, defenseless kids?* Have our kids, our very own flesh and blood, become mere digits to them?* Do optics weigh more on ECDA‚Äôs mind than the welfare of toddlers?* Or have abuse cases become so routine that they do not provoke any special urgency?We know the government will do a thorough post-mortem of their response and find a good rationale for every step taken or not taken. The road to the top of a government career is paved with disarming rationalisations. But I am a parent, and you do not get rationalise my children away. And you cannot paper over the trauma that the victims may carry for the rest of their lives.&#x200B;"

The ban mainly involves products such as spinach, parsley, broccoli and milk.The country's Food and Drug Administration will continue testing produce coming from Japan and will keep the public informed of its findings, the office said.Separately, **Singapore** said it found radioactive contamination in four samples of vegetables imported from Japan and has extended the ban to food from two more Japanese prefectures.Singapore's Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority said radioactive contamination was found in Mitsuba (Japanese wild parsley), Nanohana (rapeseed plant), Mizuna (Japanese mustard) and perilla leaf samples.The **New Zealand** Ministry of Forestry and Agriculture is also testing some Japanese food items for signs of nuclear contamination.South Korea on Monday expanded checks to include dried and processed foods imported from Japan. On Friday, Korea said it would ban imports of produce from radiation-affected areas with immediate effect. **Thailand** has expanded the scope of its tests and asked traders to avoid importing fruits and vegetables from Japan's Honshu island.**Other countries that have imposed restrictions on food imports from Japan include Australia and the United States.**While countries are stepping up efforts to stay vigilant, the potential for danger to human life through imported food is still considered limited as these are very mild levels of radiation.Singapore's AVA said in a statement that an adult will need to consume 3.5 kilograms of contaminated vegetables to receive a comparable level of radiation that is present in an X-ray. An adult individual will need to consume 184 kgs of contaminated vegetables to be exposed to as much radiation as a normal human being receives a year from direct sunlight and other normal sources.Moreover Japan is only a niche exporter of food and ships food products worth about $3 billion a year.Yet, fears of contaminated food may have an outsized impact on Japanese fresh-food exporters even though **contamination risk is currently restricted to the prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Chiba and Ehime**.If the crisis continues, it could be bad news for apple and strawberry exporters of Japan's Aomori and Miyagi prefectures and seafood and milk products exporters in general.Despite efforts by authorities to reassure people that the potential for contamination remains limited for now, the nuclear crisis is having a psychological impact on patrons of Japanese cuisine in Asia.""We used to get a lot of our fish and ingredients from Japan.

"Is it an open secret that voting is not anonymous? Everyone receives a Voter Serial Number on their voting card in the mail.

The voting ticket has a serial number at the back ""No.1234567"" for accountability purposes, of course.This makes me wonder, that means they can just see who voted for whom because all you need to do is to take the voting ticket and find the Voter Serial Number that this ticket was issued to and they know which citizen voted for which candidate.

Link: bit dot ly slash appealtoNAFAImage: https://i.imgur.com/TAJcCh1.jpgTLDR: A strong turpentine smell came from my table on Thursday, 24 August 2023. Turpentine was poured on my belongings, artworks and materials. I am currently still recovering from symptoms such as rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my nose and eyes. This is my appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again for a thorough investigation, and for disciplinary actions to be taken towards those who were responsible for the act.Thanks for reading the following post. I am one who believes in spreading positivity on social media posts. Unfortunately, this is my final resort as I believe that more can be done to assist in the turpentine incident that I had raised. And I would like to hereby appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again and take disciplinary action towards those who were responsible for pouring turpentine onto my table, belongings, artworks and art materials on Thursday, 24 August 2023. On 24 August at 9.30am, I left some of my belongings, artworks and art materials on my studio desk. The studio is located at NAFA‚Äôs tower block. At 5.30pm, I came back to the studio and noticed a strong smell of turpentine coming from my table. The smell was also coming from my belongings, artworks and art materials. I went to the toilet immediately to get a tissue paper, soaked with soap and water and cleaned the table. My hands started to experience fiery sensations and I quickly packed my things. About half an hour after that, I experienced breathing issues and dizziness. My eyes and nose have also since experienced fiery sensations. Since the episode, I have repeatedly consulted doctors with regards to my symptoms and have not been able to attend school or complete my art assignments at all. In addition, I am not able to use any of my art materials since they have already been contaminated with turpentine. Currently, I am still recuperating from the symptoms of rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my eyes and nose. The incident had not only affected my physical health, but my mental health. I have been feeling angry, sad, anxious and confused all at the same time. What saddened me the most was that I had also shared some of my pre-existing medical conditions to the class, and yet, with the information provided, someone or a group of individuals had harmed my physical harm through the use of a hazardous chemical. I would like to highlight the following: 1. People who have pre-existing medical conditions deserve the right to study and work in a safe environment.2. Persons who have pre-existing medical conditions share their struggles in living with various conditions, not to be harmed.3. No one (regardless of whether they have or do not have pre-existing conditions) should never have their physical body harmed in any way.My heart just feels heavy at this moment and I‚Äôm crying while typing this. I would never wish for anyone to go through what I had gone through. And if anyone had gone through the same, I feel you and you are not alone. And please do the necessary by speaking up about what had happened and seek medical and professional help, if necessary. A school should be a safe place for students, whether physically or psychologically. However, in this situation, my physical health has been compromised. I hope NAFA will take actionable steps to investigate the situation, take disciplinary actions towards those who were responsible and their accomplices for the act."

This concern was already directly addressed in the [FAQ](https://whatsenough.sg/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)In the 2021 study, 15% of participants lived in private properties but 18% lived in public rental flats (provided by the HDB for lower-income households)At 15% it reasonably [represents demographics of those living in private properties in 2021](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-singapore-residents-living-in-condos-rise-in-households-with-fewer-members)This transates to each focus of approx 8 participants, having between 1-2 participants living in private property and 1-2 participants living in lower-income HDB provided rentalsWhen it came to items, all had to agree it was a ""need"" in order for it to be on the budget. If there was no consensus, it was left outMultiple rounds of focus groups were used to identify this list of ""needs""For Jewellery, an example is a mother who had an annual budget of $50 for jewellery and participants echoed that for things like earrings, hair clips and brooches are necessary because it is important to look presentable at work.Unfortunately, I could not find an example for perfume.Examples of ""Holidays"" were 4-day-3-night trips to Ipoh and Port Dickson by coach. If this holiday is not catered for in the budget, it would mean that families on a basic standard of living will never be able to travel outside of Singapore in their lifetimes. No participant suggested this was a reasonable minimum. That the Ministries raised a point about this reasserts that the parties are operating on vastly different opinions of ""Basic""&#x200B;C. 16ii asserts that ""lower-income families qualify for and receive more financial help""The issue raised by the study is that means-testing and other eligibility factors are too restrictive and not sufficient to achieve a basic standard of livingAnd there are definitely lower-income families who have fallen through the cracks and do not receive excess support. To not account for them would be remistD.In 16iv the Ministries mentions their ""analysis suggests that the proposed monthly MIS budget of around $1,680 per capita is similar to the average monthly expenditure of $1,650 per capita for all families with children rather than reflecting a more basic set of needs""However, this may be a more purely economical, calculating and cold figureIt may not take into account the more human aspect of living which is what the MIS accounts for. The elderly Singaporean auntie that works as a cleaner should be able to afford ""respect, security, and independence"" in her own country.It is also not certain if the number accounts for potential issues like medical issues or other personal needs   Additional thoughts on other points will expanded on if asked in the comments, post is too long alreadyTLDR; Gov seems to think Minimum Income Standards as ""Basic mean for Survival"", the study and participants see it as ""Basic means of Living"". Dunno if its accidental miscomm or intentional disregard"

"In person scams, look out for our elders This is something I witnessed exiting the MRT. A lady dressed in black was walking ahead of me quickly to the escalator. I was going quickly too and overtaking the same people she overtook. As she walked by an elderly Chinese uncle, she suddenly slowed down to his speed and started talking to him. I'm pretty sure he didn't know her. Damn fishy behaviour.I had to overtake and caught a glimpse/overheard her. She didn't look or sound Singaporean but started asking the uncle something. I stopped by the side a few more steps ahead and looked straight at her. I made sure she knew I was watching her. She said a few more things but the uncle smiled and continued walking. She gave up after a while and walked off. I went to ask the uncle if he knew her and what she wanted. He said she wanted him to buy her a meal and asked if she approached me too. Then he said it's probably a scam and laughed it off. Glad he was aware and alert. I wonder if anyone else has observed this and if anyone has fallen for it?"

"Mooncakes recalled after high levels of bacteria causing food poisoning found [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mooncakes-recalled-after-high-levels-of-bacteria-causing-food-poisoning-found](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mooncakes-recalled-after-high-levels-of-bacteria-causing-food-poisoning-found) SINGAPORE - Two types of mooncakes ‚Äì Joymom‚Äôs Musang King Snowskin  Mooncake and Fragrance‚Äôs Single Yolk Lotus Paste Baked Mooncake ‚Äì were  recalled by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) after they were found to  contain high levels of bacteria that causes food poisoning. In a statement on Wednesday, the SFA said that it detected *Staphylococcus aureus*  (S. aureus) in Joymom‚Äôs Musang King Snowskin Mooncake. The agency also  found aflatoxins, a type of toxin produced by fungus, in Fragrance‚Äôs  Single Yolk Lotus Paste Baked Mooncake. Both substances were present at levels exceeding the maximum limits stated in Singapore‚Äôs food regulations, said the SFA. The importers of the products, Taste Right and Fragrance Foodstuff,  were directed by the agency on Wednesday to recall the mooncakes. The  recall process is currently ongoing.S. aureus is commonly found in the environment, and on human skin or  in noses, and can cause food poisoning when it is introduced into food  during the production process, particularly when good hand hygiene is  not practised, said SFA.Symptoms can include sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhoea.Aflatoxins, on the other hand, can contaminate food as a result of  fungal contamination, and are known to be genotoxic and carcinogenic,  meaning they can damage DNA and cause cancer, the agency added.   Foods that can be contaminated include cereals, nuts, oilseeds and  processed foods containing these ingredients. It is crucial to keep  exposure to aflatoxins as low as possible.The expiry date of Joymom‚Äôs Musang King Snowskin Mooncake is March 5,  2024, and the Fragrance‚Äôs Single Yolk Lotus Paste Baked Mooncake  expires on Oct 20, 2023. Both products were imported from Malaysia.Consumers who purchased the affected mooncakes are advised not to  consume them, said SFA. Those who have already consumed the products and  are concerned about their health should seek medical advice. Consumers with inquiries can contact the place they bought the mooncakes from. &#x200B;"

"Is Singapore really doing all it can to improve the problem with low birth rates? ELI5 why the government shouldn't simply ""throw more money"" at the problem, especially if we have the funds to do so. Our birth rates have been on the decline for so many years already, so surely the government already saw the writing on the wall several years ago. I'm at that age where a lot of my friends from JC/Uni/NS are already a few years into their marriages, with many of them thinking about kids. One of the most common concerns they have about children is the sheer cost of raising a child in SG.I'm not familiar with policies surrounding the matter but watching from a distance, it's always something that's intrigued me. Given the general affluence of our country, and the vast amount of funds we have in our reserves, why doesn't the government simply try throwing more money at the problem?"

"Wife got attacked yesterday My wife & I are expats who've lived here for almost 8 years. We love it here, the country, the people, the food, just all has been awesome. We've had our share of cultural misunderstandings & challenges over the years, but we've never had to deal with any serious altercation or dispute. Until last night.My wife & her friend were riding their bikes on the PCN around the Holland Park area, when an uncle on the path raised his arm to cover his face and yelled at them to lower their lights. To be fair my wife's light was pointed sightly too high, so I understand his complaint, only when they passed him he raised elbow and hit my wife on her arm. Luckily she didn't fall off the bike, but she came home with a massive bruise where he hit her.I'm still in disbelief that this happened. This is the sort of shit you hear about when discussing gangs or other lawlessness. Honestly I'm not even sure what I would've done had I been there. I cynically don't think he would've hit her with a large male behind her, but if he had, what could I have done? I'm definitely not getting into a fight if it's not to defend my life, but would calling the police would've been too much? Could I have been able to stop him from leaving? This is so outside the realm of what normal experience is that I'm having hard time processing."
"""P"" plated cars have all but disappeared You young/uns might not have noticed this but I've been driving for 3 decades.  I've noticed that the triangle plated cars are no longer common on our roads.  Where you used to see at least 50% of cars with a P plate (usually it's a family car shared by whole family, including new drivers), now on my 20 min morning commute I notice only 1 or 2.I'm not sure when this drastic drop happened - might be a good news topic for a journalist to pick up to ask a driving school.  Does this mean in 10 years time (Singaporeans only allowed to drive taxis and PHV at 30) we'll see a huge drop in available drivers and large increase in fares?We could speculate the usual suspects as to why this is happening, COE makes car ownership unrealistic while Grab is convenient, low birth rate is finally hitting home etc?"

"The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated One thing I've noticed with the PR effort, and likely by extension, the policy thinking, around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive. Have you seen the posters? ""Give your car a break - take TEL3"".Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/Uploads/Investor_Relations/AGM/sbst_agm_minutes_2019.pdf) that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA's ridership estimates of 500k. That it still produces losses in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.Consequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.Firstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and since waiting time is a KPI, bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs. We've all seen and complained about bus bunching. Breaking these long routes to reduce bus travel time should happen.Secondly, in the north and soon east, reconsider the regional relevance of the City Direct system and other similar services (850E, 951E, 982E, etc), travelling on expressways to the CBD during peak periods. Peak-period expressway congestion results in longer travel time compared to the off-peak ideal, which means bus companies, again, have to devote more resources to ensure a consistent waiting time and punctual departures. By shifting these to the MRT system, bus resources can be conserved to improve intratown and short-distance travel.Thirdly, there must be consideration on beefing up local services to better connect people to new lines. It took five years to provide a DTL connection to residents of Bedok North Ave 4 with the amendment of Service 18 only done in 2022. This ignorance of MRT connections still exists, with the new [Service 163B](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/news/introduction-of-service-163b) literally ending one stop short of Lentor MRT. This means that there is no additional capacity, or reason, for Sengkang residents to use the TEL to avoid the NEL.Fourthly, travel times. Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal. Bus-only systems in other cities also suffer from the same problems, and that's why Ong Teng Cheong pushed to have the MRT built. There is space to optimize the MRT service and it should be taken. Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this. Lastly, all of us must also realize that there are other factors such as reliability and punctuality, which the MRT can do better; and as Singapore's workforce shrinks and labor costs increase, automated MRT lines are the solution to managing these costs. In contrast, new bus depots under construction even contain foreign worker dorms, indicating that the LTA foresees we will still need to import foreign bus drivers en masse.The ~150 buses or so in storage pale in comparison to the billions of dollars spent on MRT lines that so far remain underused. The DTL costs $20 billion, the TEL $25 billion, and that's before operating subsidies paid out to keep the lines afloat. We are opening new MRT lines every year until 2032, and if they don't learn this lesson now, they may be bleeding out on the CRL; with CRL designed more for relieving the existing network than providing new access.Ottawa even had to break their bus-only system, replacing it with a train. A majority of bus services were cut back to the train terminals instead of going to downtown Ottawa, and they're a much smaller city than us. Planned extensions to the Ottawa O-Train also include pushing the bus terminals further back into line extensions, to split them up and prevent them from congesting a given terminal.Opening a new rail line every year literally means we need to do something like this every year, but that is not happening. The expectation of ""build it and the car drivers will come"", which served us well during the NSEWL and perhaps NEL years, is no longer relevant - all the more so when bus companies were able to see the impact of the coming MRT then and adapt their networks accordingly.Now you wonder why transport ministers keep talking about sustainability, but so far it seems to be all talk and no action. If MOT wants to cut public transport costs, this is where it should start, by recognizing the impact of the MRT early and taking proactive steps to manage it. There's probably more than 10 years worth of adaptation to be made."
"Bus only lane laws I have over 30 years driving experience, and am still unfamiliar with some of the marking I saw on the road.  I know what a bus lane is, but I now start to see bus only lane..  There are those that's painted red, and yesterday night driving out of Tampines North Dr. 2 to Tampines Ave 12, I got greeting by another bus only lane which is also the only right turn lane leading to  Ave 9.  So being a law abiding citizen, even when it's late at night and no other car in sight, I turn left, thinking there should be a U-turn for me to turn to Ave 9, and I also want to explore that area, but no U-turn and didn't even notice any when I reach a junction at Pasir Ris Dr. 1 which is roughly 1KM away from Tampines North Dr.2I am still not sure how to tackle all these bus only lanes.  Those red ones, I avoid, and even late at night, I stay  away from it because of habit, and there's always a U-turn or alternate lanes I can use.  ie, along Upper Bukit timah road there is a bus only right turn into Bukit Timah Shopping center, and I will use the U-turn at the junction above the underpass which is just a short distance away to reach places like Chun Tin Road.But the one at Tampines North Dr.2 really got me thinking, it's marked Bus Only, not red, and how the residence there get to Ave 9?"

Often happen late at night around 10.30pm-1am and occasionally in the morning at 7am or randomly in the afternoon. It usually lasts for 45 mins to 1 hour+. We have submitted complaints a few times through One Service App, but the workers came to investigate in the afternoon when none of these noises was happening. We also called EMSU  2x to check it out in the middle of the night, but those guys never turned up (only called me the next morning to say they have escalated this to TC). Honestly so frustrated about this because this has been happening in the past 1 month and it has been disrupting my rest. Before that, everything was perfectly fine."

"Xenophobia is real, warranted, and ultimately the employers fault. And idt there's much the government can do about it HOOK  We've all heard or actually experienced the FT phenomenon: when specific nationalities intentionally curry favour with superiors or with management, as opposed to actually being of value to their job scope, department, or company-at-large.  LINE  The trouble really begins when superiors/ management falls for their schtick. It's not enough they get promoted beyond their technical or management ability. It's not enough that immediately in these positions, they start passively/ unconsciously or even intentionally undermining or alienating the locals.  SINKER  It's when they are, in time, given direct or implied managerial responsibility over local peers, and/ or over hiring/ vetting applicants, or being part of interview panels. In certain sectors, that's the death kneel. What may seem to be inadvertent or unintentional will soon turn out to be intentional; only applicants of their nationality passes the vetting processes or interview phases and get hired. This is especially so in companies gat are establishing regional HQs and thus mass hiring. These periods of corporate hiring clamour can last from as short as 8 months, to 16 or even 20 months.  By then, entire departments are overrun with certain nationalities. And certain nationalities are so overtly nationalistic that they begin to insist upon certain rights by the logic of ""there are so many of us, Singapore should adapt culture to include us"".  My first specific example would be Pinoys. Few years back there was a mini fuss about some Filipinos were openly grumbling that Phillipines National Day should be a Singaporean public holiday, and that some of them insisted on displaying/ flying the PHILLIPINES flag during our own National Day.  My second specific example would be Indians. No doubt, some would have heard the expression Chennai Business Park. Which would not be an inaccurate observation if you just walk around the area at lunch. The problem is that the companies setting up shop in CBP are mainly using these foreigners for BPO purposes; Business Process Outsourcing. Better understood as customer service and backroom processes. Someone has to man the Tier 1 customer service hotlines. Someone has to run the IT departments, or whatever departments that specific industries designate as ""cost centers"" and thus look to get away with paying as little as possible while keeping specific essential functions inhourae for various reasons.  So what's the solution, really? Even the best solutions that come out of our manpower/ trade and industry politicians, particularly of the Phillip Yeo era cut of cloth, are ineffectual and ridiculous; Mah Bow Tan, Lim Hng Kiang, Lim Swee Say's ""faster, better, cheaper"", and the current iteration, Josephine Teo.   What's common in all of these politicians is that *none* of them have ever held a private sector role. All of them from 2G onwards, are public sector technocrats who have no real understanding of the insidious forces at play when it comes to private sector work environments. You have doctors, economists, an army general. But nobody actually from the private sector who has ever had to work their way up, even from middle management.  I am writing this to breathe credence and open a discussion into the notion that the fear , anxiety and actual phenomenon of being outflanked and pushed out of our jobs during regular economy downturns, when we are in our mid 40s, are very real. It breeds discontent and fuels the vitriol, rightfully so, since you have good workers or managers being replaced or retrenched, in favour of foreigners who focus on currying favour on bright sparkly projects as opposed to actually doing work and contributing value."

"In response to a recent r/singapore post on how to increase ridership for new rail lines... A while back on the more public transport-related side of r/singapore there has been one post in particular generating quite some buzz due to its highly controversial message. Unfortunately it came at a time when I was particularly committed elsewhere, hence this very late posting (the original post was published on 6th October 2023).[Link to original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/?share_id=e4osWcyr4HfMJLVRQAc5q&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=3)Nonetheless it contains much dangerous confusion in public transport discourse locally which we should be aware of and steer clear from. I am in no way implying the author (or OP as I will refer to) is out with any malicious agenda, but it is good to be aware of unhelpful thinking that doesn't improve public transport, and avoid it actively.To tl;dr the long 990-word essay that OP has typed up, he wonders why the TEL (and DTL), despite operating in revenue service its third stage already and currently serving the CBD, is still not ""performing as well"" as expected. There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form ""sucks"" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it's the case and suggest possible remedies. Unfortunately, this complex line of reasoning is riddled with fatally inaccurate assumptions, shaky logic, and prioritising the wrong things, which was why the long scholarly-appearing piece came off as offensive to many common folk who actually experience the system on a daily basis, and more critically ***rely*** on it in their lives.The entire issue of underperforming rail lines, while a factual reality, has been framed entirely wrongly by OP, from the very start of the piece.>Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents.Once issues concerning public transport (planning, operations, or management) are framed from the angle of revenue (or worse, ***profits***), the point of the discussion is lost, and further reasoning along this line of thought only digs a deeper grave for the OP. Public transport **cannot** be run like any normal business would -- outside dystopian levels of urban density the free market would simply not produce public transport service that would be of acceptable quality and quantity to us. To frame public transport issues predominantly as one of dollars and cents (as was described by one commenter on OP's post) misses the point, as well as the far more nuanced role that public transport plays in Singapore's society beyond just generating revenue for the government. To start off the post by quoting the TEL's farebox recovery rate **assumes** that public transport (*as a whole*) should be profitable on its own, when more often than not, the greater social goals of a connective transit system with abundant quality service often means otherwise. As commenters in the original post have rightfully called out the OP over, metrices of ""sustainability"" for a public transport system cannot be limited to just cost and revenue! Do you measure the benefits of healthcare and education in just dollars and cents? Yes, but such finance-based assessments in the real world examine the **aggregate** economic impact on the entire economy, rather than immediate costs and profits!First up, the OP needs to be realistic, especially when considering the situation of newer rail lines here. Unlike the older 6-car lines which almost entirely pass through dense HDB estates for a large majority of the route, the DTL and especially TEL do not nearly serve as much density. There is only so much you can do with hub-and-spoking the entire system around that single line serving lower density before the network structure gets very out of proportion, as the OP himself will demonstrate to great irony later. A chicken-and-egg relationship exists between service and ridership, but OP gets it just wrong. What is necessary to convince commuters to do a mode switch to ride trains? **Service.** You can build it, but if service fails to meet the mark (and being in Singapore, commuters have very high expectations for transit service), forget about getting riders on trains. If we wait until the TEL is completely full before improving service, OP basically says ""how about never"", given that the density along TEL makes it unrealistic to expect crush loading that necessitates better service. On the other hand, proactively improving TEL service would better convince existing bus riders, and motorists to switch. Mind you, the TEL is competing against highly robust bus services operating well enough during the peak to convince passengers to stay despite the opening of Stage 3 over a year ago.OP proposes that the recently-introduced Service 163B be extended to become a feeder for Lentor station on the TEL, in supposedly an effort to relieve the[ overcongested NEL](https://sgtransportcritic.wordpress.com/2021/04/13/2021-breakdowns/) by *diverting passengers from Sengkang to ride the TEL from Lentor*. Now, if the OP has actually pulled out an actual map, or even consulted (!!) Google Maps, it should be obvious that no rational commuter in their right mind would actually pick such a route over one that already exists for them in the north-east! Towards the city, queuing in line for a jam-packed NEL train is still twice as fast as detouring all the way to Lentor and boarding the TEL. Those heading north already have 161 and 965, which could be improved further but otherwise are robust options! For the same journey, one travels further and incurs additional time penalty. Who would willingly switch, unless forced to? Maybe if their destination was directly along TEL2, but for most cases 163 already provides a direct trip anyway.In a similar vein, the point of amending bus routes (at least, not until rationalisation became the key motivation for such) is to create a more interconnective overall network that incorporates, and acknowledges the ability of both modes to create a system that, to the best of its ability with resources available, provides fast, convenient and connective journeys for all. To make it clear, nowhere in the previous sentence implied ""forcing commuters to choose the train when a bus does the job equally well"", unlike what OP is implying with the example of Service 18's amendment to serve Tampines East station. Nothing's wrong with it, until its intent gets twisted out of context. In any case, numerous train disruptions over the past decade demonstrate that forcing people on trains is a foolhardy idea, despite the presence of additional parallel rail lines in recent years. Look no further than the NSL and TEL's interconnected breakdown streak this year.OP claims that ""long milk-run routes"" are *less reliable*, as if there was a correlation between bus route length and reliability, when truth to be told, there is none. Feeder services can throw you ridiculous bunching and clumping nonsense too when demand surges during the peak periods, as any resident in towns with ""dual-loop"" feeder services can attest.That aside, OP makes a truckload of confused and incorrect assumptions about buses and what they can (or can't) do, almost all of which are unfounded by a bit more international awareness. Unfortunately, these tropes also commonly heard elsewhere, so it's worthy examining them here.Perhaps the most fatal of them all that guides the bulk of the post was the notion that buses are *inherently* unreliable or inefficient, for no reason other than them being buses. It shouldn't be hard to see why this is patently false -- even our LTA's own efforts, however half-baked, shatter such simplistic caricatures of what buses should be like. Continuing the train of thought from above, OP claims *""bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these \[long trunk\] routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs""*. While subtle, it is an insinuation that buses inherently get stuck in traffic, and hence are definitely less reliable. This is also OP's favourite attack against buses in general if one reads his other works elsewhere on the internet -- ""buses get stuck in traffic, hence are less reliable and ***must be replaced by trains!!***"". Uh, nope. Heard of something called a ***bus-only lane***? I know Singapore doesn't have much of those (Bencoolen Street being the only working demonstration of this), but is this not a call to instead strengthen bus priority, rather than calling for their outright demise straight away...? Initiatives such as signal priority (the real one where the buses actually rig the signals) and dedicated bus lanes from around the world easily disprove OP's argument. Arguing in a similar vein that congestion forces bus operators to have to dedicate more disproportionately more resources towards trunk operations is also unfounded. Refusing to improve bus priority beyond current efforts afforded by LTA is an ***institutional*** issue arising from underprioritisation, not an ***intrinsic*** issue to buses as a transport mode themselves.Besides being stuck in the old mentality about buses, much confused talk from the OP shows he doesn't have any idea what he's going on about.May I present this big brain statement from OP:>Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal*How much do you hate buses, so much so that you think traffic congestion is caused by them???* Whether out of intellectual dishonesty, OP is missing the forest for the trees here. I seriously wonder if he actually thinks peak hour traffic congestion primarily consists for buses, from the way this argument was framed.  ü§Ø Also... *is it not during the peak period, where bus priority initiatives are at their most effective????* Recap: bus priority initiatives are oriented toward giving buses an advantage over cars in situations where the latter would be stuck, such as general congestion, or traffic junctions. What is the OP getting at here?In further confused talk, OP pits trains vs. buses in reliability to prove the superiority of the former. The big elephant in the room being missed here is that when talking about something as interconnected as public transport, reliability must be seen from a **system-wide** level, rather than on an individual line or mode level as OP implies. Having a part of the network being less reliable than the other due to institutional inertia does not help the reliability and resilience of the overall network, and results in worse outcomes for all, which runs counter to the spirit of building up the network in the first place.The fallacy of rail being inherently opposed to buses due to the mode type runs prevalent in the post, with OP claiming again, that because buses are buses and trains are trains, the latter can be automated while the former cannot, thus making trains even ""better"". Such a statement cannot belie OP's ignorance of bus automation projects around the world that have been ongoing for at least a decade, with the[ most recent demonstration in Scotland and Dubai](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/scotland-cavforth-autonomous-bus-project-stagecoach/) featuring the equivalent of a full-sized single-decker bus here, running autonomously with the crew only monitoring operations. With Singapore still choosing to put hostlers on ***every*** train on the automatic (GoA4) lines, the point on manpower savings is only as effective as the improved staff to passenger ratio a train gets compared to the buses it replaces, and when automation is so prevalent in future that no staff are needed on board throughout, OP's point is but moot.In his quest to argue for rail to replace buses as far as possible, OP demonstrates his lack of understanding of how buses work here, and how they're used. Ironically, his suggestion to break up long trunk routes into smaller segments goes against his own mantra of a hyper-efficient transport system, as two shorter routes will require marginally more resources to operate. Each end of a bus route typically requires 1 extra bus parked, for layover purposes, so breaking a long route in two means adding an extra set of buses laying over at two extra ends. There's also the issue of the city area having insufficient bus infrastructure to actually handle that many routes being split up into two, for the matter.OP then claims that ""shifting long-haul trips to the MRT"" would enable bus resources to be ""conserved"" for shorter trips. To translate the lingo into simple terms, OP advocates for a hub-and-spoke style public transport system, which has been demonstrated to be wildly inefficient in serving large areas with fewer resources, as the experiences of Woodlands and Yishun since the 1990s have shown. That aside, OP will do well to actually check ridership statistics of feeder services compared to those of trunk and long feeder routes, because if longer trips by bus constitute the bulk of all bus rides, then forcing them onto the rail network will not end well, especially with a rail line plagued by disruptions, already overcrowded rail lines, and rail lines built severely under capacity. Hell, I'll be generous and be willing to concede on this point if combined ridership of feeder and long-feeder routes exceed trunk service ridership!Let's look at some more word salad:>Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this.Based on what OP describes, the ""compact bus network"" in question is a hub-and-spoke one, almost entirely consisting of only feeder buses. Of course, if you deleted every trunk bus route off the map today, we'd suddenly find ourselves with an immense surplus of buses and manpower, and it would be even possible to make every feeder run at two-minute intervals! Yet despite such, ""bus passengers who don't touch the MRT"" would not benefit, simply because they no longer exist! In a hub-and-spoke transport system, there would be highly limited scope of public transport trips that would not involve going beyond each town, thus making the benefactors in this argument a very niche group that hardly travels beyond town boundaries...Picking the right arguments to make your stand is one matter (which OP fails at), and finding the appropriate examples to back up your claims is yet another. The international example chosen to support intensive bus cuts (Ottawa) is one of the worst possible, even within Canada. OP cites how Ottawa ""broke their bus-only system"" to accommodate the opening of their O-train light rail system, specifically how bus routes previously plying into the city were ""forced back to terminate at O-train stations"" to prevent ""congesting"" downtown terminals. Canadian readers looking at OP's post are dying from second-hand cringe, knowing full-well how[ the terrible implementation of the O-train](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-ottawas-lrt-didnt-go-wrong-it-started-wrong/?gad=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI48i_wI20ggMVwieDAx20JQoBEAMYASAAEgJbC_D_BwE) has resulted in worse ridership for public transport overall.[ While many Canadian cities saw transit ridership generally increase, Ottawa has been struggling to achieve this trend](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/drop-in-transit-ridership-has-officials-across-canadastumped/article30178600/). A more instructive vignette is to look at how it fares compared to Vancouver, which has only 60% the population. More importantly, their TransLink doesn't engage in the same drastic scaling down of bus services to favour rail service. Yet, Vancouver has three times as many riders on transit than Ottawa. OP probably hasn't realised that Ottawa's dismal ridership figures are a red flag that he isn't quoting an appropriate counter-example. This comparison is a demonstration that what really matters in getting people on public transport is ***not*** mode, but rather the quality of service. Ironically, this answers the initial question that guided OP's entire post -- ""how to get more people to ride new MRT lines?"" Well, improving TEL services proactively is a good start.OP further notes that Ottawa is a small city compared to Singapore, and thus if a smaller city gutters its bus network, we should as well right? To break his bubble, us being a larger city instead means that we have ***redundancy requirements*** that a smaller city would not necessarily need. And even so, given the amount of trouble Ottawa has encountered with their light rail system, they will do well to have it too.It's about public transport versus cars, as OP likes to say both on Reddit and elsewhere. He claims that since our public transport usage rate and COE prices are sky-high, it's difficult to convince motorists to switch. Newsflash: decimating the public transport network by converting it to hub-and-spoke and making trips by public transport more of a hassle is only making more people switch to driving instead, and of course, if they're getting that COE at all cost, it won't be given up so easily ***unless service improves sufficiently to convince them otherwise.*** The way OP wants to go about reworking public transport here only vindicates the choice made by these newfound motorists.Realism is a nice thing to have when looking at policy issues, but like all nice things, there isn't enough of it, and unfortunately it's not found in the OP's post either. He writes that the ""build it and they will come"" mentality is no longer applicable to new rail lines, and thus implies that ridership on newer rail lines must be ***forced*** (from cutting parallel bus routes, as has been done for the DTL twice in 2020 and 2021). OP should ask himself how much can actually be squeezed out of bus ridership before the detrimental effects of service cuts to the overall network structure does more harm than good in encouraging people to take public transport rather than drive. In a similar vein, the argument that the large-scale bus service cuts that were initiated from the MRT's early days up to the early 2000s should be continued reflects a lack of awareness of the current conditions of the system. With newer rail lines featuring smaller trains that max out at lower demand, bus cuts should be done minimally, only for routes that do not already have the ridership to justify themselves, nor a unique sector that cannot be served by amending other routes. This is not to say that we cannot ***reorganise*** the bus system -- we certainly can and should, but we must be conscious of the final outcome being a *net increase* in service, rather than a decrease, as is the case now.In the middle of his post OP brings up the name that almost every Singaporean now associates with the MRT -- Ong Teng Cheong. In the context of the arguments OP was making (he was arguing that buses were the cause of rush hour traffic), this appeal to authority is irrelevant, and stricter critics would find this a highly dishonest portrayal of Ong's legacy, where it should have been one of seeking constant reform, to fix what isn't broke before it breaks. Until we can cover every last inch of Singapore soil with rail, it is equally disingenuous to claim, as OP subtly implies, that rail rapid transit is the silver bullet for all of Singapore's public transport issues. For one, that would be a reckless waste of taxpayer money, itself a problem asking to be fixed.Since OP loves to view things from a money-minded perspective, here's a money-minded response to a money-minded take on public transport operational cost. Billions of dollars spent on ""underutilised"" MRT lines? According to the ADB, Singapore loses anywhere between[ 8 and 20 billion SGD](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/asia-s-cities-need-quality-public-transport) ***every year*** to traffic congestion. By comparison, that's how much an **\*entire\*** rail line costs here. Even the scary ""S$2.5 billion"" annual subsidy is insignificant compared to this, when you recall that this sum is how much is paid out to subsidise ALL train services, as well as all buses too. These rail lines are already paying for themselves from the day they commence revenue service, by reducing congestion on the road and saving the national economy the financial penalty of traffic! This is why it remains important to target motorists to induce a mode shift to public transport -- it is how these rail lines recoup their costs!

He also showed low situational awareness almost hitting car when he wanted to move one lane to left and car two lanes to the left wanted to move right one lane. With prayers, we got to the airport alive. We immediately contacted Grab, making sure to have live chat with support, to beg them to block him from accepting another ride for few hours until he gets some sleep. CS just talked about, oh we will give him a strike for misconduct. We will educate him for next time etc etc. We told them we were not interested in punishment but it was urgent safety situation that he doesn‚Äôt take another fare before sleeping.

"North-South Corridor: A Progress or Peril for Singaporeans? The North South Corridor (NSC) is a multi-modal transportation corridor/expressway that is currently under construction in Singapore. It was first announced as the North South Expressway on 30 January 2008. This year, 2023, was when it was expected to be completed. NSC is expected to bring some benefits to Singaporeans, such as reduced travel times and improved connectivity, it also has had a number of negative impacts. Let's look at the issues observed thus far.&#x200B;**Delay in Construction Timeline**NSC was initially planned with an expected completion date of 2023. Then 2024, 2026 and 2027. The latest news is that it will be fully completed only in 2029, 6 years later than previously announced. The delay is partially due to Covid-19 disruptions - but covid disruptions isn't even half as long as the delay. Other challenges include challenging terrain conditions and land acquisitions.&#x200B;**Localized** **Pollution**Residents near the NSC have been affected by noise and air pollution, and some residents even reported trembles in their blocks. Construction activities often run late into the night. Although LTA said that it avoids noisier construction activities at night, mainstream news have reported otherwise. Air pollution from construction activities are often underreported due to the fact that no government agency actively monitors the surrounding air quality at construction sites.&#x200B;**Travel Inconvenience**Travel from North to South and you will see the countless road diversions and bus stop re-locations. For road users, the diversion of traffic have led to confusion, longer travel times and congestions. For public transport users, it means travelling to a further temporary bus stop, often without original supporting infrastructure such as shelters and proper walkways. As somebody who can only afford public transport, this frustrates me the most. Walking is tough, and cycling on pedestrian paths is next to impossible due to conditions of the makeshift roads. LTA has also shifted 4 bus stops in the vicinity (and all of them further than before) and they won't bother building sheltered walkways for the ""temporary"" bus stops for the next 6 years.&#x200B;**Health Impact**Higher levels of air and noise pollutions arise from the increased traffic and increased construction activity. This cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and negatively impacts sleep quality and mental health.&#x200B;I'm aware of other issues concerning the environment and businesses but I would leave them up to you guys to share. We all know that NSC is a major infrastructure project that is likely to have a significant impact on Singapore roads in the future. However, I thought that it is important to be aware of both the benefits and negative impacts of the project, especially since the delay means that current stakeholders will have to endure these issues for a longer period. In my opinion, the government can take further steps to mitigate the negative impacts of the project. What do you think?"

It's disconcerting to feel that this dedication is not reciprocated in the professional realm. The silent battle many Singaporeans face in the workforce against individuals from other nations is a harsh reality that needs urgent attention.Promotions and project opportunities should be based on merit, dedication, and skill, not nationality. It's disheartening to witness the blatant favoritism that creates a toxic work environment, hindering the growth and morale of many deserving individuals.It's high time we address these issues and foster a workplace culture that values diversity and equal opportunities.

"Amidst all the talk about 167 are we forgetting about the truncation of service 162/162M With all the talk about 167 getting axed and then getting reinstated, I wanted to bring some attention to the other forgotten service that is getting heavily truncated, 162M. &#x200B;LTA says they want to truncate service 162 due to route overlap with the TEL's journey from Bright Hill to Shenton Way. However, 162M only duplicates the TEL from Bright Hill to Orchard, before heading towards Suntec and looping at Esplanade. Due to the stark difference in routing, it doesn't make sense for it to fall under LTA's TEL route rationalisation. The service serves as a direct link from town to many housing estates eg. Sin Ming, Bishan and AMK, and also runs way past the last NSL and TEL train departures from town. (The last bus leaves Suntec at 1230am, which is 45 mins after the last NSL train departs City Hall).&#x200B;I've been taking the service home after going out in town as it gives me the choice to sit down and avoid the crowded post-dinner northbound NSL trains. It takes approx 50 mins to get from Suntec to Bishan Park, and it would roughly take the same time if i were to take NSL to Bishan, walk to the bus stop and change to another bus to take me home. At most, I'd save 10 minutes on a good day, but I would gladly trade that 10 mins for greater comfort and a break from walking about town.&#x200B;By truncating 162M, the authorities are missing the forest for the trees. It's all about trying to achieve higher KPIs, lowering costs, and better transport times on paper, but it doesn't benefit real residents in any way. &#x200B;This time it was my estate. It could be your neighbourhood next. Even if you're not a resident in these estates, we have to let the authorities know what we think of their unilateral decisions.

"Weekend musings: a proposal for a more equitable model of car ownership and usage in Singapore This is an area that is close to my heart, an intersection between social equity and urban planning policies. I have an idea for what I think is a fairer, more equitable model for vehicle ownership and usage, and I'm curious if people agree or not - and I'd love to hear why it isn't feasible.I'll start with what I think the problems are. Firstly, the COE system is too blunt of a mechanism - while it is extremely effective at capping the number of vehicles that exist, it has a few drawbacks. It does not care about who ultimately is the recipient of that entitlement - whether it is a multimillionaire adding to his sports car collection, or a father of 2 who needs to ferry his kids to school before work. Secondly, the COE only limits ownership, not usage.For actual vehicular usage, we have to look at parking fees and tolls (ERP), as these directly ""tax"" (I use the term loosely) vehicular usage. Parking is easy to reason, it charges drivers for ""leasing"" land to store their vehicles. ERP tries to modify travel behavior by tolling usage of certain roads in certain directions at certain timings (corresponding to direction of rush hour traffic), and tolling drivers entering the CBD region. However, there are several problems here. Parking rates in Singapore are ridiculously under-priced as compared to other cities of similar standard of living, development, quality of life, etc. I would also argue that ERP tolls are disproportionately cheap compared to the cost of car ownership. Together, they are woefully inadequate at discouraging car usage; and combined with the high cost of car ownership, it leads to the emergence of the ""all-you-can-eat"" phenomenon, where car owners feel like they should use the car as much as possible (at low marginal costs) because they have already paid a huge upfront cost that last only 10 years.What this means is that car owners tend to be wealthy (to afford car ownership in the first place), and they are incentivized to maximize car usage (because of low marginal costs of using their cars).**2-pronged proposal:**1. Eliminate, or greatly expand the number of COE quotas, to drastically drive down the cost of car ownership such that it is attainable for most people.2. Drastically increase the cost of car usage in scenarios when there is the most cost to society.1) is pretty straightforward, owning a car should be within reach of most people. But to prevent the gridlock traffic and crippling congestion we see in other car-infested cities, car usage policies need to be reviewed and reformed.Consider the 2 following scenarios:1. An additional car on the road adding to the morning rush hour traffic on southbound CTE by a driver commuting to the CBD2. An additional car on the road at 10pm by a night shift worker commuting from Pasir Ris to JurongThese scenarios are not the same in terms of their cost to society. In the first scenario, the marginal cost to society of car usage is a lot higher than the second. Road capacity is fully utilized, every additional car causes congestion that delays the commutes of everyone else on the road. In the second scenario, the marginal cost to society is low, because there is low traffic anyway. Car usage policies should very strongly reflect the cost to society, and penalize the first scenario accordingly.I think a more equitable model of car ownership and usage would see a lot more people having access to cars, but also less usage at rush hours. There are a lot of legitimate use cases for cars (recreational activities involving transporting sporting equipment, ferrying children/elderly, running multiple errands all over the country, etc.) which should not be easily accessible only to a privileged minority. There are also a lot of negative externalities associated with car usage (air pollution, noise pollution, accidents, congestion, etc.) which should not be produced by a minority to be suffered by the majority. If we could reduce weekday rush hour traffic by taxing the hell out of driving during that time, and also allow way more people to be able to transport their bicycles to ECP to cycle on weekends, or visit out of the way locations like Sungei Buloh reserves, or even night shift workers commuting to their workplace in the middle of the night when public transit has stopped their services, wouldn't that be great?"

"On recent bus amendments (75, 121, 162/M, 167, 859) -- and a possible solution to retain 167? [Where next? -- STC](https://sgtransportcritic.wordpress.com/2023/12/08/where-next/)Recently all the roar has been around the proposed amendments around a couple of bus services in the city area because yadada their ridership fell and TEL ridership tripled. What's more worthy of noting is what is in store for us in the years to come, as this round of service cuts is showing us. Attached above is my take on the recent TEL3 rationalisation exercise. It comes a bit late, but comes with the benefit of seeing how the entire saga played out between unhappy residents, the media, and LTA themselves.Alright, enough negativity. Here's something I'd like to add to all the hate against 167 getting withdrawn, or degraded to 30 minute frequency: here's a proposal to make it more financially viable, without having to sacrifice any of the other ""duplicating"" bus routes (ie 162, 980) either! Spoilers for those eager to hear: make 167 faster than the rest.

"LTA needs to acknowledge the capacity issues plaguing the NEL and CCL This is a long post so strap in:Basically, as it stands, CCL and NEL crowding is at a critical level, and the LTA refuses to acknowledge that this problem even exists. They have tried some solutions (for the NEL), but it's far from enough compared to **infrastructure improvements made directly to the lines**. Without their acknowledgement or action, this problem will only worsen as Singapore (and especially the NE region) densifies.Let me explain everything in that above statement:# 1. Why are these 2 lines in particular the most acutely overcrowded?It may come as no surprise to those who commute during the peak using these 2 lines, but waiting 3 or 4 trains has become the norm at certain stations like one-north, Buona Vista, MacPherson, Tai Seng, Hougang, Kovan and Little India. Even barring that, CCL and NEL trains are usually significantly more crowded than their counterparts on other mature lines NSL and EWL. As it stands, the NEL is the only line to serve the (now) ultra-dense districts of Sengkang and Punggol. Both have grown to be significantly more dense than the town planners could have ever hoped for (just look at Waterway Point on any day, really), causing the NEL to exceed ridership forecasts by large margins every year. And with new districts like Northshore, Fernvale or even Buangkok Cres coming up over the next few years, ridership is only set to increase by that much more.The CCL really just has 1 major flaw - it is a 3 car line that serves districts that deserve 6 car trains. Areas like one-north, Science Park/NUS, Tai Seng and even National Stadium are major commercial trip generators which have progressively built up since the opening of the CCL and are continuing to be built today, causing crowding to slowly build and reach the levels that we are at today. This is without even including the connectivity role the CCL plays, being basically the only option for trips from the west (Tuas/Jurong industrial areas) and southeast (Paya Lebar, Bedok) to the aforementioned NE (dense residential).# 2. What has the LTA done in an attempt to relieve overcrowding?Despite not acknowledging the issue explicitly, the LTA has implicitly acknowedged that this is urgent, as they have attempted several things to relieve crowding issues on these 2 lines.a. New trainsThe C851E batch of trains is the first new batch order of trains that is solely for line capacity increase since the 2012 order for the C151B (the C151C was ordered to complement the CBTC resignalling). They are hoping that the C851E will do the NEL and CCL what the C151B did to the NSL (prior to the C151A/C151B, NSL users were also waiting multiple trains before boarding). For the NEL, this brings the line capacity from 33,000pphpd to 38,000pphpd translating to a 15% capacity increase. For the CCL, this brings the line capacity from 16,000pphpd to 22,500pphpd translating to a 40% capacity increase.b. City Direct busesEver stood along Shenton Way during peak hour and see the neverending lines of 6XX buses going to destinations like Buangkok, Anchorvale, Hougang and Punggol? It's no surprise that basically every NEL station has a separate city direct service, and that every one of such services is now run using a high capacity public bus instead of a 40 seater coach. However, even these buses are limited in what they can do, as they are subject to congestion along CTE/KPE, and each bus can only carry around 140 if packed to the brim, compared to even 1 NEL train that can carry close to 2,000. c. Travel Smart JourneysLTA has introduced and expanded the TSJ programme in recent years. Its explicit aim is to decongest the NEL during peak hours. However, its utility is limited as similar to the City Direct buses, each bus can only carry so many people, and with a lower frequency that makes it even less able to reduce the congestion on the NEL****You may have noticed that many of these schemes target the NEL. That's because crowding on the NEL is highly directional. It's towards the city in the morning and away from the city in the evening. This makes planning alternative transport easy. However, the CCL, being circular, has no real start or end to the crowds. It's quite clear that the two headline stations for the CCL are Bishan and Serangoon, but beyond that, it's not easy to plan effective bus services for the CCL, which makes finding other alternatives even more important. # 3. Why is a solution so desperately needed for the CCL and NEL?a. The MRT system as a whole is bursting at the seamsNotice how every time there's a disruption the recovery plan always seems to be absolutely terrible? That's (unfortunately) a result of under-forecasting for ridership. Our MRT system has woefully limited redundancy and won't be able to cope with disruption of a major line. With the recent TEL woes, the other lines (mainly NSL) have mostly been able to absorb the extra passengers as the TEL at peak isn't really full, and trains are only half as often as on the NSL and 2/3 as long. Now imagine if the NSL had a fault on the scale of the rail crack discovered at Promenade recently. Areas such as Bishan, AMK, Lorong Chuan and Seletar will now cram onto the already overcrowded NEL > CCL causing even more headache for the already weary commuters for those 2 lines. Couple that with the bus route ""rationalisation"" (read: cuts). While such major disruption is now (thankfully) rare, it doesn't mean that it won't happen again, and underpreparing for such events will just lead to each incident becoming more and more unmanageable.b. The demand generators on both lines haven't stopped expandingThe aforementioned demand generation areas, especially one-north, Punggol and Marina Bay, have been expanding rapidly over the past few years, and it shows no signs of stopping. Without a clear plan to increase capacity beyond just adding new trains (which can be flawed, see below), the 2-3 train wait could easily turn to 5+ trains, which would seriously turn away commuters from public transport and turn more commuters towards already congested (and pollutive) roads like Serangoon Road (NEL) and the ORRS (CCL).c. Adding new trains isn't infinitely scalableThe new C851E order pushes both the CCL and NEL fleet basically to capacity. If every train is deployed on the lines, headways will be around 2mins at peak. Even at current 2min40-3min frequencies, there is already regular bunching at major interchanges like MacPherson, Caldecott and Buona Vista. Without a corresponding plan to reduce dwell time (time stopped at each station using techniques like closing doors faster or stronger deceleration), the signalling system will be the limiting factor anyway, thereby rendering the extra trains moot.# 4. Is the CRL going to solve this problem?NO! The CRL will defintely help, but the manner which it can is extremely limited. Imagine you work at Fusionopolis, and you live at Sengkang. Would you take a train from one-north 40mins to Sengkang, or hop on a 20min 74 bus ride to SIM/NP, take a 30min ride to Hougang followed by another 20-30min bus ride? The CRL will relieve some demand from commuters travelling from Tuas to Punggol, but those using the Circle Line from Kent Ridge, one-north and Buona Vista (the 3 main groups anyway) will not switch, ever. The CRL may also help by pushing commuters at Tavistock and Serangoon North onto the NSL when they currently use the NEL, but even that effect is limited given the majority of commuters are from deeper into the NE region.# 5. So what can be done then?Instead of trying to chip away at demand by skirting around the lines, why not get at the heart of the issue - the line capacity itself. Given that, the most appropriate solution would be to lengthen the platform and extend the trains. Both the NEL and CCL were built with significant length platform overruns, allowing a 4 car train to stop straight at almost every CCL station (barring a few like Promenade) and a 7 car train to do the same on the NEL. To push it further, select stations (like Bishan, Chinatown and Serangoon) and probably accomodate 5 and 8 car trains. LTA can consider employing SDO (selective door opening) to safely manage door operation, meaning at some stations, the first and last doors will not open. This will make the car ends less crowded, incentivising those travelling between the ""long"" stations to use these areas of the train. Upgrading every train to 5 and 8 cars can increase line capacity by 67% and 33% respectively, which coupled with the extra trains, can solve the capacity issues in the medium term.This isn't some new or novel idea either. It has been done before. Both London's deep level tube lines and Hong Kong's MTR have successfully attempted platform and train lengthening, with Hong Kong's Ma On Shan Line doubling from 4 to 8 cars before merging with the WRL to become the Tuen Ma Line.That doesn't mean it can be done quickly. Similar projects have taken between 4-6 years between project announcement and completion. This means that even if the LTA were to announce it today, we would likely only see results between 2028-2030. But for LTA to even get started, they would have to acknowledge that this is a problem, and I'm not sure that's going to be the case for a while. So until that changes, we have to live with bad and worsening crowding on the CCL and NEL."
"Easy fix to current COE allocation Make it a lottery similar to the BTO allocation.This fulfils the primary role of the COE system, which is to cap the number of cars on the road, although now not by price but by luck.This removes the sky high prices due to corporations, [private hire vehicles](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/easy-financing-and-private-hire-fleet-expansion-driving-up-coe-demand) and rich families buying multiple cars.  **What about equity and fairness? Some may need it more than others.**Give additional ballot chances/set aside a higher proportion for families with children, with each extra child garnering one extra ballot. This has the dual benefit of boosting population rates.  **What about the resell market?**Tag the COE to a person instead of a car, ban reselling of COE. Individuals who do not use their COE to buy a car would have their certificates reclaimed, which could then be auctioned off by the govt.**Reduced governmental revenue?**The main purpose of the COE was never to collect more money, it was to control the vehicle population. **Critiques of Satellite based ERP system**First and foremost, the privacy concerns are huge. 24/7 legally enforced real-time tracking of your vehicle is dystopian.

"Why is job market always ""Bad & Horrible"" and will it ever get better? Since graduation in 2016, i have been told that job market was bad.  My first job took nearly half a year after my exams (3-4 months after finance degree cert), Have changed jobs in the past few years and manage to find contract jobs in the meantime with a few months of space in between most of the time and meanwhile always hearing about horror stories about people quitting without job and being unemployed for 1 year+.  It seems that when we ask people everytime about job market, the reply is always bad bad bad.  What exactly do people mean when job market is ""good"" and did this ever happen in the past decade? Will we ever reach that peak again?  &#x200B;"

"Opinion: Most of Singapore's current problems is due to overpopulation Just got to thinking about most of the problems that people around me tend to complain about which made me come to a conclusion that many of these problems are due to the sheer number of people cramped on a tiny island vying for too little resources, and that many of these problems could be resolved if we could hypothetically reduce the population drastically.A couple of issues I was thinking about. &#x200B;1. **Housing Crisis**: The long queues for houses and the frustrating process of applying for BTOs (Build-To-Order flats), often leading to multiple rejections or settling for less desirable units, are clear indicators of overpopulation. The demand far exceeds the supply, leaving various groups, including singles and the LGBT community, struggling to find a place in this tight market. This housing crunch is a direct result of too many people vying for limited space. The ratio of buyers to available units are 10, 12 or even 15 times the number of actual availability. Imagine a group of 10 sharing a meal meant for one.2. **Overburdened Public Services**: The strain on public services is evident in the long queues at polyclinics and the difficulty in securing medical or dental appointments. Hospitals are overwhelmed, struggling to provide beds even for those with severe health conditions. This pressure on healthcare systems is a consequence of having too many people needing services that are limited in capacity. Try to get an appointment at any polyclinic it is impossible. Try to get one at a dental clinic, you need to queue many months in advance. Doctors and nurses are overburdened. Even beyond healthcare, everything else is jammed up from usage of public gyms to public transport to public parks. Everything a facility is made available for public, you can imagine 1000 others going for the exact same thing. Pools are filled to the brim, parks are crowded a f, malls are crowded and all F&B are fully seated, Gyms have 3 people waiting for one station.3. **Automobile Affordability**: In many parts of the world, owning a car is within reach for the average person. In Singapore, however, the limited car quotas, designed to control traffic and pollution, lead to exorbitant prices, putting car ownership beyond the reach of many. This issue stems from the sheer number of people competing for a limited number of vehicles. Everyone bids and outbids each other because there are too many people. This then pushes people to public transport, which itself is extremely overburdened.4. **Educational Access**: Gaining admission to kindergartens and primary schools has become a competitive ordeal. Parents find themselves queuing, balloting, and often struggling to secure spots for their children in preferred institutions. This intense competition for educational opportunities is another symptom of overpopulation. At the tertiary level its the same, there are only so many slots universities and trade schools can accomodate. 5. **Job Market Saturation**: The Singapore job market is disproportionately small compared to the population size. While many multinational companies establish headquarters here, the local market potential remains limited. So companies aren't here for the market they are here for the knowledge, tax incentives, etc. But there is just too few of such jobs having to serve such a large population. The result is an excessive number of applicants for a finite number of positions, leading to high competition and job market saturation.6. **Leisure Activities and Space**: Even leisure activities in Singapore require planning and competition. From booking concert tickets to dining in restaurants, everything needs to be pre-arranged and often balloted for. The scarcity of leisure opportunities and space is another byproduct of having too many people in a limited area. If there's an interesting event, I don't even bother booking because either you can't get a ticket or it will be too crowded. Look at Geylang Serai Market, or Coldplay Concert, etc. The relentless presence of crowds is a constant in Singaporean life. From squeezing onto public transport to queuing for nearly every aspect of daily living, the stress and unhappiness many feel can be traced back to overpopulation. There's a stark contrast when visiting neighboring countries, where one can instantly sense the abundance of space and resources (albeit managed not as well as Singapore, in fact pretty poorly in some places), unlike the scarcity and cramped conditions in Singapore.  One queues to squeeze in public transport, to get to a job one has to  queue for, to raise a family one has to queue to support from education  to healthcare to leisure, just to queue for a house that is not easily  available. Singapore is an island with no resources, no land, and surrounded by a climate that makes us feel really uncomfortable. But we have 6 million people that are fighting each other for very little resources. That's why everyone is so unhappy.What do you guys think?"

"Industry Consultation for A New Not-for-profit Private Acute Hospital Model The Ministry of Health (MOH) is inviting private healthcare operators to  participate in an industry consultation for a new not-for-profit  private acute hospital model. The industry consultation will be held  from January to April 2024.  2. With increasing demand for  healthcare services due to an ageing population, acute hospital bed  capacity needs to be increased in both the public and private healthcare  sectors. The new not-for-profit private acute hospital model is meant  to provide more options for Singaporeans who wish to seek care in the  private healthcare sector.  3. The private acute hospital model will incorporate the following features:  a.  Not-for-profit, i.e., profits are not distributed to its shareholders  and are instead reinvested to the hospital and/or for charitable and  other not-for-profit activities;   b. Provide appropriate and affordable care to patients, with a stronger emphasis on cost efficiency and value;   c. Focus on serving mainly Singapore Residents; and  d. Provide some subsidised acute bed capacity.  4.  Participants of the industry consultation will be invited to provide  feedback on the proposed acute hospital requirements and suggest ideas  on how the key objectives for the new hospital model can be achieved.  More details will be released to participants upon successful  registration.  5. Interested private healthcare operators can register their interest at  [https://go.gov.sg/ptehospconsult](https://go.gov.sg/ptehospconsult). Registration will close on 21 January 2024.

"Is it really worth the few minutes saved to rush for the MRT as the doors are closing? (Spoiler: it’s not) I was headed to work this morning. My train comes, the doors open, I board it. Usual stuff. Just as the doors are about to close, a young man is sprinting from the escalator. It doesn’t look like he’s gonna make it. He’s gonna cut it close. The doors shut and I glanced over. The young man is stuck between the doors, a look of anxiety with a hint of relief at having made it into the train washes over his face. With fervent might, he pushes himself out from the death grip the train doors provide. I am mildly annoyed for a moment because he could have very well caused a delay what with his body being caught in a dangerous place and all. But my annoyance soon turns to mirth as I realise he is missing a shoe.The young man turns towards the doors, his face once again filling up with anxious urgency as he realises that one of his shoes, an aptly-named slipper, had slipped off his foot and landed on the other side of the now-closed doors due to his haste. He looks helplessly at the lone slipper now left behind. This man - otherwise dressed decently in a plain shirt and cargo shorts - is now left standing among his fellow train passengers with but one shoe.He has won the battle of the doors. But at what cost?At the next station, he gets down and walks defeated to the other platform to take the opposite train back to whence he came. He stands resolutely facing the train doors, likely afraid to look around at the judgmental eyes piercing through him.In trying to save a few minutes of his time, the fool ended up having to waste another 10 mins having to go back and forward again.What a dumb ass."
"Why I feel that SimplyGo is very inconvenient and Nets Flashpay should not be discontinued With the announcement of the discontinuation of Nets Flashpay for paying bus and MRT rides, I want to voice out as to why I find simplygo a hassle. Source: LTASG’s instagram post dated 9/1/2024, as at the time of posting, it was announced about 2-3hrs ago.The advantage of simplygo is that it allows mobile topup and checking of balance, however, I find way too many issues with the system which is why I switched to nets flashpay.For context, I switched to simplygo because the staff said I could get $2 rebate. Then, I had to keep using app to check. One fine day, the entire simplygo system went down - I can’t check balance on app AND I couldn’t even topup my card at the topup machine. I ended up using nets flashpay and when I learnt nets flashpay is going to be no longer allowed, I’m very disappointed.First issue with Nets flashpay is that you need mobile data to check balance, if for any reason the network is down, you need to go to ticket machine to check. This can be a problem if you don’t auto-topup like me. Thankfully I live near MRT. However, I need to keep checking and looking at app just to ensure I have enough if I want to ride bus so that I don’t realise I have not enough and need go MRT station topup/pay cash.Second problem is this - how would I know if I got properly tap in/out (applies to bank card as well)? If I walk to the gantry and the person infront use simplygo, and then I tap and gate remains open, I can only assume I tapped in. Unlike nets flashpay, if I tap in/out, I confirm will know that I successfully tap card unless the person infront hv the exact same balance and pay the exact same fare as me. I like the 2000s era ezlink card system which is still being used in nets flashpay cards, I know how much I left after a ride and I can just go and topup instead of guessing how much I have in my card and I’m basically left being reliant on a system that if it is down or network is down, it is back to the 2000s where I need to go to the machine to check. Given that based on ltasg’s instagram post stating that “simplygo transactions are processed backend”, my suggestion is to just reconsider and not discontinue nets flashpay “because two in three adult fares are made with simplygo or bank cards” for the convenience of users who still want to see their balance. Moreover, if a system outrage happens on the simplygo system AFTER the discontinuation of nets flashpay, how am I supposed to pay for my ride if I can’t topup? Pay cash fares or use bank card? In this case I might as well use bank card instead of simplygo?I completely do not agree that nets flashpay should be discontinued just because at least 67% switched payments. In the end, this should still be left as an option just like how one ticket machine still accepts cash topups (although honestly, why can’t it be improved so that ALL of the machine accept cash but that’s a discussion for another day)."
"TIL that despite Singapore’s COE policy and lower car ownership rate, it has a higher percentage of trips by cars and average annual mileage than Seoul. Source: https://www.clc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/books/walkable-and-bikeable-cities.pdfThis is shocking to say the least. As of the date of this study, Singapore’s average annual mileage is 17,000km, almost double Seoul’s, and about triple NYC’s. I am cautiously optimistic though, because I do sense the shift in attitude in the government’s recent plans and policies. The government has acknowledged that building more car infrastructure is a fool’s errand, and I am personally excited for the 2030 cycling network and the upcoming NSC. Fingers crossed that cycling picks up, and we get a ton more infrastructure and create a heck of a virtuous cycle."

LTA's Response On SimplyGo Not Being Able to Show Trip Fare & Card Value at Fare Gates. Thoughts? (TLDR - SimplyGo uses a backend processing system that makes it unable to display fares & card values)I sent this query last year to LTA and got this response. I don't know much about how their system is designed so I'm not too sure whether it really is a technical limitation that they can't send the trip fare and card balance information back to the fare gates. Maybe someone who has more technical knowledge can share?
"My laymen idea on how to make SimplyGo display balances instantly. Disclaimer, I am not a software engineer or developer so this could be completely wrongheaded. But I was thinking that since it takes a long time for the backend to compute the fare and return the card balance, why not make all terminals store the balances which are synced with each other. When someone taps, the current terminal computes balance and then displays it, and then afterwards sync it to the main server which would then proceed to sync to the rest of the terminals + the app? Top ups would go the other way around?With an upper limit assumption of 10million users, each terminal has to store 10 million card ids + 10 million balances. Assuming each value is 4 bytes, that's 150Mb at most so it's not unreasonable. Most thumbdrives contain hundreds of times the space anyway. Let me know if this is a dumb idea or not?"

"Simplygo app deducted my card balance to 0, not sure what happened. I was setting up and organising my Simplygo app and noticed I had 2 cards on the account.Card A is a concession card (orange-peach colour) with no name and an unissued status, if I recall correctly. Card B is my normal ezlink card with around $40 in it. I only remembered adding Card B so I went ahead and deducted Card A, thinking it was some old student card concession that had expired. Then I realised the value in Card B, my original ezlink card, had dropped to 0.Not sure what happened but I wonder if deducting the concession card had anything to do with it. Would I be able to get the balance back if I asked at the MRT ticketing office? Would appreciate any advice as I'm still new to this Simplygo thing. Thank you!"

"A Modest Housing Proposal We all know about the lease decay issue in the Singaporean housing market. Leases are meant to decay to zero value, yet many people still hope that the government will somehow compensate them (to assist in relocating or for other needs).Here's a proposal: allow foreigners to ""buy"" (or effectively, long-term lease) HDB properties with less than X years left on the lease. We'd need to determine a smart number for X. Alternatively, or maybe more simply, HDB could allow rental contracts for these properties to match the length of the remaining lease, say up to 10 years, instead of the current 2-year maximum.This could address the need for cash for those with leases too short to re-sale effectively, while also expanding the rental housing supply. Thoughts?"

"Unidentified weird man near Eunos/Tampines MRT Hi guys, my friend got harassed by a weird man yesterday at Eunos MRT and he just wants to check with other Singaporeans if they have encountered the same situation from the same individual. The scary part is that this is his 3rd encounter with the person, with these encounters spanning a period of 2 years. This post will detail what happened yesterday, followed by the description of the weird man.Yesterday's encounter:The weird man approached my friend while he was with his girlfriend and aggressively went up to his face (literally inches away) saying that he looks very familiar, asking if he was from the same secondary school as him while touching his arm. My friend said no and gestured for him to leave but as they were leaving the location, they could hear the man following them. They then picked up their pace — and that was when the man did the same, blocking their path; and again, touched his arm and said that my friend looks familiar, asking the same question of whether or not they were from the same secondary school.My friend's gf then shouted at him to leave and he backed off for awhile, but he was still loitering around them for a few minutes, after which he approached a few different people, initiating non-consensual physical contact (touching and holding shoulders/back etc.)Apparently my friend's friend encountered him before too and they found out that his method of approach is always the same, asking if a guy is from a certain secondary school, then telling him he looks familiar. He also seems to approach guys with a fit figure.Visual description of the individual:Age - Mid to late 30sHeight - 1.65m to 1.70mBuild - SkinnyHair - Short and messy, black with white strandsAttire - Black shirt, cargo pants, shoes/slippersMy friend has since lodged a police report but was just wondering if anyone here knows who this person is because he was abit shook from the experience. We also feel like being able to identify him will help the authorities in getting him the help and care he requires. Any help would be appreciated!"

Background : I am in government services as a contract staff, looking for a job change.IT sector, and received lots of interview invites.I understand that some of govt services are opening for tender during this period. But the annoying part is that ALOT of IT consultancy firms are inviting me for interview.... Which during the interview, they sneakily/ roundabout-ly ask questions that try to make me reveal secrets.Most IT consultancy companies do Zoom interviews.Even worse are those that wants me to turn on camera, but their cameras are off, which i outright challenged them for their disrespect and unprofessionalism.""What is the size of the project you handling?""""How many people are there in your team?""""What kind of server are you handling?""""What is the specific method you are using?""""What are the kind of confidential data you are delaing with?""Like what the fudge man.Yes, it might be a genuine interview, but even after i have told them that its confidential, they get defensive and try to dig out an answer. ... Some of my colleagues who have really good credentials (like ex- FAANG), also got interviewed, went through similar questions... But never got any reply back from them after a respectful and proper interview.Even more Especially suspicious when its a HR with India-Indian accent, they just ghost you after the interview or phone call.So i am thinking that they might be calling an interview just to dig secrets ... Is there anyway to report them?"
"LTA Bus Timing is ridiculous The traffic condition is considered light and good. No traffic jams and no bad weather however, at 10:40 the bus 197 was estimated to be “Arr” next moment I realised I waited till 11:05 to board. Didn’t realised that Arriving meant 25 minutes waiting. Not possible to have better transport planning?"

"Street-hail rides dwindle as Singapore’s taxi population continues to shrink https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/street-hail-rides-dwindle-as-singapore-s-taxi-population-continues-to-shrinkFor me, I personally prefer using Grab  or other hailing app, because it can come to my position. Also, the earlier frustration of wanting to get a taxi but cannot get one, either on the street or via phone call. (Situation more than 10 years ago, so grab is a very useful service to humanities. )Overall, there is more good than bad. Also, the attitude of the grab driver is better as the app have a rating feature. I think we should just give them 5 stars if everything is ok, don’t need expect too much, as long as they are courteous and get us to the right location. I think taxi still have a place in Singapore. Earlier, I thought to support taxi, and book taxi using grab system, so that the taxi driver can drive relax, and I pay the meter fares accordingly, instead of fixed fare. When I feedback this to the taxi driver, they agrees too. However there is one incident, I notice that the fare entered is higher than the metered fare. It could be an oversight or something by the driver. The thing is if I did not take the picture of the fares. And the fares entered in is higher, I have no recourse. So everything is dependent on the taxi driver keying in of the fares.Taking a picture of the fares at the end of each trip gives the impression of not trusting the driver. The ideal situation is if there is a linkage between the metered fares and the app, but I believed this requires high level integration, and I don’t believe there will be the effort done, even though it will benefit everyone. I think grab also want to take care of their own PHV.Right now, I will alternate between justgrab(fixed fare) and GrabTaxi (meter fare)"
"Salary Ranges on MyCareersFuture And Lowballing Does anybody know the salary ranges for job postings on MCF work? Are they supposed to be base salaries only or inclusive of CPF and bonuses?I recently interviewed for a role and am now at an advanced enough stage that HR has started discussion around compensation. HR claimed that they cannot offer me a further raise as the current figure is already top of the band. E.g MCF salary range says 10-20k, but HR says 8k is the max they can offer.I am also pretty sure it's not a matter of job levelling or insufficient experience as I exceed the minimum years of experience in their job description. I actually applied for this role selectively after checking the salary range on MCF to ensure there's a chance they can meet my asking. It would have been a huge waste of my time if that figure is just not true.Are employers allowed to post anything they like when it comes to the salary range (i.e false advertising) or is this just a lowball attempt by HR?"
"An Idea to Reduce Taxi Queue Times at Changi Airport So I had the fortune (or misfortune) of departing from Changi Airport Terminal 2 at 1AM this morning (13 Feb). As you can imagine, there was an influx of passengers via air, all returning from their holidays abroad or coming for their holiday, after escaping CNY with their families. All of them were seeking to catch a grab or taxi out of Changi Airport, myself included.My experience was unfortunate to say the least. I joined the taxi queue at 1, and only got my ride at 01:53AM (according to my taxi receipt). When I joined the queue, it was only half the length seen in the picture. It doubled and kept growing as I was leaving. Everyone was also trying to get a grab at the same time and nothing was working. You’d see one victor escaping the queue but that was few and far in between.It's not an ideal experience, especially when you're a visitor, arriving to see the famed Singaporean efficiency, only to be greeted with an hour long wait for taxi. It's one of the first experiences you have as a tourist and does set the expectation for the rest of the trip. This got me thinking, don't we have data that we can use to predict passenger volume and groups. Using the data of passengers arriving, we can figure out how many taxis and grabs are needed, coordinate between the transport companies to ensure adequate supply and that wait times are manageable for a grumpy passenger arriving after a long flight. There might be some incentivisation problem (how to entice the drivers to come) but we can use data to improve the experience.any other ideas that you can think of?"
"Would you support Singapore investing in nuclear energy? https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iea-international-energy-agency-open-regional-office-singapore-4117836?cid=internal_sharetool_iphone_13022024_cnaI just read this and think the strategy is probably this:- we need to go nuclear as oil will run out while solar and wind are not reliable enough for us- building nuclear plant locally is too risky both in terms of safety and political risk- building in a remote island in indo or malaysia is not going to be palatable to their citizens and we would be seen as exporting disamenities/risk while enjoying all the benefits- we would also be held hostage if the power plant is in foreign soil (think water issue version 2.0)- so next best thing is to get most of ASEAN onboard- build a regional power grid and have a (few) nuclear power plant(s) supply electricity to the regional grid- wherever the power plant is situated, the govt cannot threaten to cut off power as easily since its not just tiny singapore owning the plantSo pushing hard for regional power grid is the major stepping stone towards singapore’s goal of nuclear power generation. Would you support such a plan?"

"SG Parliament: Study of Fertility Leave for Public Service Officers Parliament Sitting: 6 Feb 2024Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: To ask the Prime Minister (a) whether an update can be provided on the study of fertility leave for public servants; and (b) if such a study has not been conducted, whether the Government will study this proposal.Written Reply by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public ServiceWe have assessed that there is no need to introduce fertility leave as a separate leave provision at this juncture. Public officers who are undergoing fertility-related procedures can already tap on their current leave provisions, such as outpatient sick leave or hospitalisation leave, or request for flexible work arrangements from their supervisors, such as flexi-time and hybrid work arrangements to undergo or recuperate from the treatment"

"Does anyone else find that our road junctions are more inefficient now? This is more so after more discretionary right-turns are removed and more lanes reserved for right-turn only. On one or two (sometimes every three) lane roads, traffic going straight cannot proceed because they are stuck behind vehicles that cannot yet turn left due to pedestrians crossing, and stuck behind vehicles that cannot turn right because of the red right-turn arrow.I'm all for removing the discretionary right-turns on busy, high-risk junctions but they are also now needlessly installed at quiet junctions resulting in a jam where everyone is stopped for no good reason."
"Are CDC vouchers partly contributing to the increase in prices? Genuinely curious and I hope to also learn something.These seemingly free money that we have been receiving in the form of CDC vouchers and GST rebates. Is it accurate to say that these are just gov printing money but in a different way since there are negative connotations when people think about gov printing money leading to increase in money supply in an economy?If yes, then this is not sustainable. Our CDC vouchers will certainly run out before the year ends, but the hike in prices due to extra demand as a result of CDC will obviously be here to stay. Then when people need to purchase goods and services with their own money, that’s when they feel the pinch. Also, people are now going to expect CDC every year. When will this vicious cycle of free money and hike in prices stop?Looking forward to reading some of your inputs."

"Proposal: Subsidised tertiary education for NSmen I've been thinking about this issue: how do we make NS more equitable for the people who served. Two years of your prime life taken away, that's a huge setback. Plus, the local sg culture has relatively made light of the sacrifices of given NSmen, compared to other forced conscription countries like Korea or Taiwan or Thailand. Singapore is already well on its path to becoming a country that's 60% non-citizens, open to talents and labor competition from all over the world. It's what keeps out economy rolling and growing. However, all that is built on the foundation of men who served and sacrificed their time and even lives. Rumblings of discontent are inevitable, when the scales of fortune are tipped against their favor. What are we in Singapore? Security guards for the rich? We need to take steps to make things right. This is where subsidised education comes in. Education is one of the best forms of uplifting one's financial situation in life. To equip the youth with skills and knowledge they can use. To support them in this pursuit. I'm not even pushing for 100% free, knowing the out cries that will come. I'm saying let's consider it. Let's consider our budget and see how much we can subsidised. This is a first step in a long term consideration of truly recognising NS and making Singapore a home for everyone, rather than a forced labour camp for some and a playground for the elites."

When i turned on the lights HOLY FUK, there's like 6-7 cockroaches LYING AROUND THE KITCHEN.   So what could i do as a tenant to resolve this matter? is the landlord supposed to keep the kitchen clean and avoid this matter? or is it im entering a deposit scam contract, which basically forced me to terminate my contract early and forfeit my deposits?"

Guys do you feel that the older generation is gradually getting shut out cos of the digitalisation of life in SG My mom just turned 60 and her workplace introduced a new IT platform that she needs to use for work. Mom didn’t even finish primary school so her English comprehension is really limited. Imagine applying those limited comprehension skills on an IT platform with a complex user interface. I wish my mom had taken my advice to spend more time building basic IT skills instead of memorising buttons for the sole purpose of watching Korean dramas but who am I to judge someone who has spent most of her adult life working her ass off and wanting to take it easy in her sixties?

"Mom was fraudulently charged, did not receive OTP nor SMS. Just helped cancel the card for my mom, but the whole situation is damn odd and might be on loophole so I thought to raise some awareness.My mom was checking the new monthly statement from UOB and saw a transaction from Apple Itunes of $11. She did not make this transaction and I couldn't find the transaction on her Ipad's purchase history.Odd thing is, she did not receive the usual ""Use SMS-OPT xxxxx"" nor ""A transaction of SGD xxxxx"" on her phone for that date nor the settled date, I looked through her SMS history and confirmed it.This ringed the alarm bell in me, what if she didn't browse through the statement carefully? Its just $11 and she could have easily missed it.It also reminded me that when I use my Citi Mastercard to tap on public transport, I don't get any SMS notification even when I set the notification threshold as $1. I think it is because the initial auth amount placed by SMRT was just $0.01 and only when they settle, they settled for whatever the actual fare was, and the notification was probably only set up for auth. This could be how the hacker tried to steal my mom's money without letting any SMS in?Anyway just want to point out this kind of thing is out there, and it is quite scary. Though amount is small, but if it went unnoticed the hacker can slowly drain our money. I hope the banks can do something about it."
