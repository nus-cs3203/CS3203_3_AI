t3_ru4v51,Whatever system we are living under perpetuates child abuse and neglect.,"Gonna be mostly a ranty post by a 16 year old cause I don't have much outlets, sorry if its incoherent.  We are all aware of how asian parents are, whatever is normal discipline can be treated as child abuse in other countries. I'm sure I went through a lot of the same shit other people in a traditional Indian family did, a non-exhaustive list includes:* Withholding pocket money* Withholding food* Forced to sleep outside the house* Forced to stand outside the house for hours* Forced to kneel for hours* Caned till bleeding* Slapped non stop for bad grades, not doing homework* Verbal abuse (idiot, stupid, r\*tarded, down syndrome)These is what I treated as normal for most of my life, and as I grew older, obviously I realised a lot of this shouldn't be tolerated, but what could I do. Weirdly enough, most of these stopped as I grew older into sec school and its just been verbal abuse. These has mostly shaped who I am today, and has led to a lot of mental health issues on my part, and growing suicidal ideation, which has been in my head for most of my life, but I only started acting on it when I was 13.It was when I was 14 that I started refusing to accept the verbal abuse, and would argue back, I think parents would call this the ""rebellious"" phase, my mom would call me a gangster. Police would be called, and they would say its disciplinary. Even after multiple suicide attempts and trips to IMH, nothing was done about my mother (father is not in the picture due to divorce).When I was 15, my older sister (2 years older) came out as transgender to my mother, obviously this did not go well, every few weeks there would be arguments, I learned to protect my sister since she was always the good kid who never got punished while I was the bad one so she would not talk back. It's not like we are trying to start shit with my mother, she would just find things to get irritated at, get irrationally angry, and we have to call the police to stop and get some sleep. So that's how it's been for the past year or two, which brings me to the past 2 days.My sister is working and wears women's clothing at work. Yesterday by chance, my mother bumped into my sister and saw her in women's clothing, when my mother got home before my sister, she took away all her women's clothing, and hid it somewhere we still don't know. Obviously my sister got really angry when she came home, but my mother would not talk to us and had us call the police, which is something that happens a lot. She will not listen to what we have to say, no matter how calm we say it, she views it as us being 'gangster' and really dislikes when people disagree with her.But the biggest reason she gets us to call the police is cause the police won't change shit. They just take our statements, calm us down, ask for ic, phone number, the usual questions, and just tell us not to provoke her. Yesterday, the same shit happened with police but we were told to lodge a police report at the nearest neighbourhood center.This morning thats what we did, and after 2 hours, waiting for the police to deal with a case that came up midway, and we were told to go home, ask for the clothes back, go to family counseling, and call the police again if she gets confrontational.Coming back home in the afternoon after lunch, we immediately asked for the clothes back, she told us not to talk to her like that (another thing she does a lot when she doesn't like what we are saying), and of course, to call the police. Knowing that family counseling won't do much since she has never listened to us once in her life, we called the police again.Same shit happened, took statements, ic, phone number. However, this time the police told us there's not much choice other than to go to court. **They want a 16 and 18 year old, to go to court, against their mother, over fucking clothing.** I told them how ridiculous this was, and they said ""It's not like theres nothing we can do, but..."", plot twist there was nothing they could do.And thats where this ends for now, I still can't believe this is our only option, something that will take probably months and many hurdles, just because my mother is a transphobic pos. She thinks she can do anything to us cause she brought us up with money and food (something she willingly took away to punish me). These parents need to realise that when they bring a life into this world, it is their responsibility to provide them with money, housing and food, not treat us like a fucking investment. All this traditional family and filial piety shit can happily disappear with our generation.Edit: Thanks for all the helpful comments, I’ll look into the advice I’ve been given, just wanted to clarify a few things. I forgot to mention in this post that we are looking to move my sister out and remove my mother as her legal guardian, the police told us to ask HDB, but I was wondering about any other people’s experience with it.And yea the police said going to court is our only option and maybe getting PPO but they also said getting PPO over clothes is a bit finickyI’ll definitely be in contact with social workers to advice us what to do from now on",Legal,-0.7,0.8,0.7,-0.9987,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ru4v51/whatever_system_we_are_living_under_perpetuates/,Reddit,2022-01-02 07:52:00

t3_rv2beb,30 and Single,"Hello, fellow redditors I am male turning 26 this year playing a 1 player game since birth was diagnosed with a chronic illness(wilson disease) during my first year of uni. It’s understandable no girl wanna date me. I tried dating but a lot of them just went radio silent after i told them about my condition. Through uni it has been hard the memory lapses, I am always tired. I have to travel to SGH 3 times a week because I insisted on being an outpatient. The left side of my body is always trembling. Fast forward till present I am lot better now. On the outside I look completely normal tall(180),built(now a bit fat but yeah). Non of my friends know about my condition because it’s hard for me to come out to other them Plus my friends are getting married and you know doing adulting stuff.I have a decent paying job, and have completely given up on dating aspect of life. I mean I got rejected like so many times and it’s hard to find a nice girl around my age to talk to. I don’t have TikTok idk what the hell are the latest trend so female younger than 23/24 don’t really have much to go on off. So for anyone whose advise is try to find a partner. Thanks really appreciate it but there is a limited amount of age appropriate female in sg and I think most of them are either taken or have rejected me. Was just wondering is there any wholesome single group I can join because idk what to do during fest seasons and the weekend.When I go out shopping a lone people my age often stare at me. I overheard this couple talking about me when I was having my dinner alone around Christmas. It was hard to hear I almost broke down and cried. But I can’t really blame them.Tdlr; 26 male single, not looking for a r/s ever.
