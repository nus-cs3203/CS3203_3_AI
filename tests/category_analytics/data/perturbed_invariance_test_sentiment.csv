22047,t3_1h7ue3h,Scam calls posing as WeChat customer service rep going around,Just receive a call from local number without +65 prefix. I was caught off guard because the was connected immediately to a human and it didn’t have the usage record call options in weirdly accented English.The call was about 微信帳戶安全保險 or “WeChat account safety insurance.” Not sure about the official English translation. I googled a little and found that official WeChat stance on this is this is a free and non-chargeable service. First person who spoke to me was a man and spoke in Malaysian accented mandarin. The second person or “supervisor” was lady who spoke in Southern China accented mandarin. They will go back and forth talking to you about the whole 800sgd. The whole scam is about Unionpay is going to auto deduct 800sgd from your bank/card for this so-called insurance. The callers claims that you can opt-out and will begin guiding you. They will guide you to official WeChat Notice pay and tell you to tap “unresolved” followed by “this is unreasonable” and “this is not helpful.” Then they will ask you if there is red colour pop up which obviously doesn’t appear because this page is a self-help page the options they told you to tap is just a normal feedback page that appears in all self-help page.

I googled a little and found that official WeChat stance on this is this is a free and non-chargeable service. First person who spoke to me was a man and spoke in Singaporen accented mandarin. The second person or “supervisor” was lady who spoke in Southern China accented mandarin. They will go back and forth talking to you about the whole 800sgd. The whole scam is about Unionpay is going to auto deduct 800sgd from your bank/card for this so-called insurance. The callers claims that you can opt-out and will begin guiding you. They will guide you to official WeChat Notice pay and tell you to tap “unresolved” followed by “this is unreasonable” and “this is not helpful.” Then they will ask you if there is red colour pop up which obviously doesn’t appear because this page is a self-help page the options they told you to tap is just a normal feedback page that appears in all self-help page.

22087,t3_1ha7t3h,"Identity thieves cancel S’pore man’s credit cards, leaving him and wife strapped for cash in Japan","SINGAPORE - Singaporean Melvin Chan’s recent holiday to Japan with his wife turned into a nightmare after he found their bank accounts blocked and credit cards cancelled by identity thieves who rang up the banks and pretended to be them.Mr Chan, 35, was at the Tokyo DisneySea theme park on Oct 7 when he and his wife realised that none of their cards were working.“DisneySea is a cashless attraction. Almost everything there requires you to pay with card - from restaurants to the express passes for the rides. I think maybe only the souvenir shops accepted cash payment,” said Mr Chan.He and his wife spent three hours calling DBS, UOB and OCBC from the theme park - racking up $200 in roaming charges in the process - and would later find out that their cards had been cancelled by someone else who called the banks.This person, who posed as Mr Chan, asked the banks to do so on the pretext that he had lost his belongings.“We were shocked to find that all my credit cards were cancelled and our bank accounts were blocked. The bank officers told us that we would need to be back in Singapore to reinstate them,” said Mr Chan, who has reported the matter to the police.“My wife is Thai... so we transferred money from her bank account in Thailand to my YouTrip travel card. She has limited funds in that account and we carried on the rest of the trip with limited funds.”Get a round-up of the top stories to start your day Sign upBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.  marketing and promotions.Police confirmed the reports made and are looking into the matter.He added that he did not lose any money from his accounts when this happened. But this incident comes as banks are facing increasing pressure to safeguard customer funds from scams and fraud.Figures from the police show that scam victims in Singapore lost $385.6m in the first six months of 2024, with a record 26,587 cases logged during that period.UOB and OCBC told The Straits Times that safeguarding the funds in their customers’ accounts is their top priority and that card blocking and cancellation were important anti-fraud measures.The two banks cancelled his cards after receiving calls from someone who claimed to be him, said Mr Chan.

Almost everything there requires you to pay with card - from restaurants to the express passes for the rides. I think maybe only the souvenir shops accepted cash payment,” said Mr Chan.He and his wife spent three hours calling DBS, UOB and OCBC from the theme park - racking up $200 in roaming charges in the process - and would later find out that their cards had been cancelled by someone else who called the banks.This person, who posed as Mr Chan, asked the banks to do so on the pretext that he had lost his belongings.“We were shocked to find that all my credit cards were cancelled and our bank accounts were blocked. The bank officers told us that we would need to be back in Singapore to reinstate them,” said Mr Chan, who has reported the matter to the police.“My wife is Thai... so we transferred money from his bank account in Thailand to my YouTrip travel card. He has limited funds in that account and we carried on the rest of the trip with limited funds.”Get a round-up of the top stories to start your day Sign upBy signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.  marketing and promotions.Police confirmed the reports made and are looking into the matter.He added that he did not lose any money from his accounts when this happened. But this incident comes as banks are facing increasing pressure to safeguard customer funds from scams and fraud.Figures from the police show that scam victims in Singapore lost $385.6m in the first six months of 2024, with a record 26,587 cases logged during that period.UOB and OCBC told The Straits Times that safeguarding the funds in their customers’ accounts is their top priority and that card blocking and cancellation were important anti-fraud measures.The two banks cancelled his cards after receiving calls from someone who claimed to be him, said Mr Chan.

Given the last three digits + year of birth, I'm already able to figure out the 5 out of 7 of the NRIC numberThe next 5 numbers are given sequentially. This means that if I'm able to figure out how many babies were born before me on year 199X, I can deduce the next 5 numbers. Given that I already know the ladt 3 digits, I only need to know the thousandth and the ten thousandth number. Singstat very helpfully provided me the number of babies born each month here: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M810051. If I add the total number of babies in months born before me (eg Jan 90 babies + Feb 90 babies + ... + X 90 babies), I can get very close to the number I was born. If I want to be more precise, I can also use the day I was born, divide it by the days of the month, and do an extrapolation to estimate the thousandth and the ten thousandth number.This so far is an estimation. However, the government has also provided tools to verify my guess. First, I could use the last letter of the alphabet, to ensure that the checksum formula coincides with the number estimated. If the number does not tally, I can plus-minus until I get the correct checksum. Alternatively, I could iterate from 0 to the number of babies born that year. Given that SG live births is < 50,000 per year on average, realistically I would only need to iterate 50 times. As a final verification, I could PayNow to the NRIC number.

22255,t3_1hgr3qh,My view on the whole NRIC saga,"**The Evolution of NRIC Secrecy in Singapore**The recent controversy surrounding the new NRIC regulation has sparked intense debate. As I reflect on the developments, I realize that the perception of NRIC secrecy has undergone significant changes over the years.**Background: The Shifting Landscape of NRIC Secrecy**Growing up in the 90s, I recall that NRIC numbers were not as heavily guarded as they are today. As a class/ CCA representative, I had access to a list of my classmates' unmasked NRIC numbers to take attendance. However, even then, there is a perception on the privacy of NRIC. I recall my grandparents and parents always cautioned me against sharing my NRIC number, citing the risk of loan sharks.**The PDPA and the Masking of NRIC**With the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the subsequent masking of NRIC numbers around 2019, the government emphasized the importance of protecting personal data. This move reinforced the notion that NRIC numbers are sensitive information to the general public.**Observations and Concerns**Despite the government's efforts to protect NRIC numbers, several observations raise concerns about the effectiveness of these measures:1. *Widespread distribution of NRIC numbers:* Prior to the PDPA and masking of NRIC numbers, these numbers were freely distributed, making it likely that they can still be found on older documents.2. *Formula of NRIC numbers:* The structure of NRIC numbers includes 'S' for those born before 2000 and 'T' for those born on or after 2000. The first two digits indicate the birth year (for the majority), and the next five digits represent the time of registration. This, coupled with the fact that the alphabet in NRIC numbers follows a fixed formula, makes it relatively easy to approximate a person's NRIC number, especially when combined with the last three digits and the alphabet.3. *NRIC numbers used for authentication:* Currently they are widely used as authentication details for government agencies and banks.4. *Public perception of NRIC secrecy:* The majority of Singaporeans view their NRIC numbers as secret and private information, often using them as passwords or for other private purposes.**The Dissonance Between Perception and Reality**These observations highlight a clear dissonance between the public's perception of NRIC secrecy and the reality of its vulnerability. This disconnect creates a false sense of comfort, which may lead to increased data theft.**Complications Arising from the New Regulation**The government's decision to move away from masking NRIC numbers raises several complications:1. *New authentication details:* The number one concern for everyone will be: what will the new authentication details be? Should the entire authentication process be revamped? The truth is, most authentication details (e.g., date of birth, address, mother's maiden name, etc.) are not exactly private information, but they are not public either. Using a sufficient number of data points should create a certain comfort level to take specific actions. These thresholds should definitely be set by the government with clear guidelines.2. *Balancing transparency and security :* While NRIC numbers may not be entirely private, making them publicly available may not be necessary or beneficial. In this regard, I am unable to understand the enhanced trust and transparency mentioned by the Government.**Conclusion**In conclusion, while reducing reliance on NRIC numbers as private information may be a positive step, it is essential to address the deeply ingrained perception of NRIC secrecy in the population. The government must clearly communicate the rationale and implications of the new regulation, ensuring a smooth transition and alleviating public concerns.**Side Notes**1. *Government communication :* The government's communication on this issue has been piecemeal and incoherent, leaving many wondering about the details particularly the intention of this new move.2. *Inter-agency coordination:* The lack of coordination between government agencies, as evident in the ACRA incident, highlights the need for improved communication and alignment.",Legal,-0.6,0.9,0.8,0.9963,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hgr3qh/my_view_on_the_whole_nric_saga/,Reddit,2024-12-18 02:03:00,My view on the whole NRIC saga,"**The Evolution of NRIC Secrecy in Singapore**The recent controversy surrounding the new NRIC regulation has sparked intense debate.

22273,t3_1hhim3r,"Govt agencies have to comply with ""comparable, if not higher, standards of data protection compared to the PDPA"": MCI in 2019","Source: [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-public-agencies-not-governed-by-pdpa-because-of-fundamental-differences-in-how](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-public-agencies-not-governed-by-pdpa-because-of-fundamental-differences-in-how)Found this old article interesting. There were questions raised back in 2019 on why government agencies should be exempt from the PDPA. At that time, Iswaran (then Minister for Communication and Information) said that govt agencies, unlike private orgs, are expected to adopt a whole-of-govt approach in delivering public services and this is very different from the private sector.But he also said that govt agencies need to comply with comparable, if not stricter, data protection standards.""Mr Iswaran noted that public sector agencies have to comply with Government Instruction Manuals and the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA).Collectively, these provide comparable, if not higher, standards of data protection compared to the PDPA, he said, adding that similar investigations and enforcement actions are taken against data security breaches.""**So was ACRA's disclosure of full NRIC numbers in compliance with the govt's own data protection standards? If not, will investigation and enforcement actions be taken?**For private sector orgs, data breach incidents have to be notified to the PDPC and affected individuals, with remedial actions taken, in line with the timelines set out by the PDPC. See [https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf)Can we expect to see some similar accountability on ACRA's part? Regardless of what the govt's future policy intent may be, we live in the present and surely ACRA's disclosure of NRIC data has to be evaluated based on the prevailing guidelines and status quo. Until the future policy intent has been fully operationalised, disclosure now compromises the data privacy and security of everyone whose full NRICs were exposed. I think it is high time for ACRA to come forward and explain just how many people were affected, how they decided on whose NRIC numbers to disclose (was it only directors and shareholders or were others included too), why they decided it was necessary to publish this database, how they ended up running ahead of future policy intent, whether they can track who accessed the NRIC numbers or could have scraped the NRIC data they made available, and what remedial actions they are now going to take.

There were questions raised back in 2019 on why government agencies should be exempt from the PDPA. At that time, Iswaran (then Minister for Communication and Information) said that govt agencies, unlike private orgs, are expected to adopt a whole-of-govt approach in delivering public services and this is very different from the private sector.But he also said that govt agencies need to comply with comparable, if not stricter, data protection standards.""Mr Iswaran noted that public sector agencies have to comply with Government Instruction Manuals and the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA).Collectively, these provide comparable, if not higher, standards of data protection compared to the PDPA, he said, adding that similar investigations and enforcement actions are taken against data security breaches.""**So was ACRA's disclosure of full NRIC numbers in compliance with the govt's own data protection standards? If not, will investigation and enforcement actions be taken?**For private sector orgs, data breach incidents have to be notified to the PDPC and affected individuals, with remedial actions taken, in line with the timelines set out by the PDPC. See [https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf)Can we expect to see some similar accountability on ACRA's part? Regardless of what the govt's future policy intent may be, we live in the present and surely ACRA's disclosure of NRIC data has to be evaluated based on the prevailing guidelines and status quo. Until the future policy intent has been fully operationalised, disclosure now compromises the data privacy and security of everyone whose full NRICs were exposed. I think it is high time for ACRA to come forward and explain just how many people were affected, how they decided on whose NRIC numbers to disclose (was it only directors and shareholders or were others included too), why they decided it was necessary to publish this database, how they ended up running ahead of future policy intent, whether they can track who accessed the NRIC numbers or could have scraped the NRIC data they made available, and what remedial actions they are now going to take.

Delivery fees are normally $4 or less, and with platform fees of $0.60, the total is no more than $5. This is actually quite reasonable!People have been boycotting food delivery and blaming the platforms, but the real reason food delivery is expensive is the vendors.Vendors have the option to use food delivery platforms or not. They choose to use them, but it’s not free. Vendors pay for the platform’s services and often pass the full or partial cost on to consumers by driving up the listed food prices up to 20% higher. In my opinion, the vendors are the real profiteers. They want to use the services but don’t want to absorb the costs. Think about it—if they had their own delivery service, you wouldn’t see a 20% price increase, even though they’d still have to pay their drivers’ salaries. Your thoughts?

22566,t3_1htjqfj,Erroneous Last Train Timings information on SMRT’s Website ,"I was going down a rabbit hole of last train timings online and found out something… interesting. And by interesting I mean entirely misleading. I found out that if you used SMRT’s website to check out last train timings from their stations, it will say that it would depart at times like 1:30, past 2:00 and even as late as 3:00 am. Note that is is not marked as train service extensions (like on eves of holidays and events like F1) but rather regularly scheduled last trains every day. To my knowledge, most last trains depart from around 11:30pm till around 12:40-12:50am past midnight. Sure enough, after cross checking with the SGTrains website, the SGTrains Website had more realistic last train timings following the 11:30pm-12:50am window for last trains. So what happened here is either 1) SMRT are running later trains without anyone knowing or, more than likely, 2) SMRT has put out blatantly false and misleading information on last train timings. SMRT website is the light mode ones and the SGTrains website is the dark mode ones with examples from Botanic Gardens, Bras Basah, Chinese Gardens, Farrer Road and Woodlands South stations respectively.

Price of item was actually above recommended retail price but I bought it anyway as it was out of stock at most other stores. Seller messaged saying they’re throwing in free screen protector, I thought nothing about it. When I picked it up at the physical store, they said the screen protector was already pasted for me, I still stupidly thought nothing about it. Went home to check the warranty status and turns out it was already activated in start Nov last year. Called the shop and they said, sometimes manufacturer will activate warranty the moment they send out stock to them. I can contact them with the receipt to extend warranty. I said I was not comfortable with a brand new product having warranty already activated and they offered a full refund. How often do brick and mortar shops do such shady business? For older folks that don’t check on warranty and stuff, they would never realise they’re getting scammed. Do share your similar experiences as well! Edit: I returned it for a refund before making this post. Went there and asked if they have any sealed boxes and they said, “oh no la, all also the warranty activated by ASUS”. Then they tried offering me another unit with larger storage (box look koyak), I noped my way out of it.Edit2: Near 12mn on the same day, the seller messaged me on Shopee asking me to go down the next day to exchange for a “brand new sealed box”.

I said yes, what's this about? He then said from records, there was a transaction of $1900 on my Maybank credit card and they were calling to confirm that the transactions were made by me. I couldn't make out WHERE the transactions were made to as it was pretty noisy in the hawker center, but I replied that it was impossible as I had already closed off all my Maybank accounts and cards some months ago (which was true). By this time my brain was telling me this was a scam call so I was on alert.He said he would check and I could hear sporadic typing in the background and he came back on the line a few seconds and asked if my NRIC ended with <last 4 digits of my NRIC> to which I said yes (heck, its public info by this point). He went on to say that his records showed that I had opened an account in early January this year and there were 2 transactions on my card totaling $1900. I then asked him which Maybank branch did I supposedly open this account at, and he replied the Jurong Point branch.He then asked me if I had received a notification about the transactions, to which I replied that I had already deleted all Maybank apps etc. after the accounts were closed. I then asked him, ""so what next?:He said he needed to ""check bank protocols"" and the pretend-typing started again. He then came back on the line in a few seconds and said I needed to do a few things. Firstly, he couldn't close the accounts for me, as there were outstanding transactions on my card. So I needed to make a report with MAS. He then asked me ""you know what is MAS?""By this time, I had been on the phone with him for 5 minutes and auntie was waiting for me to pay her with my CDC voucher, so I just cut him off and said I would call the Maybank hotline directly and hung up.

Do we really need to pay so much money as taxpayers for this level of solutions?I can never understand why do we need these mayors or why our MPs need to have their pay pegged with the top private sector when they literally are public servants. (On top of being board members in several companies and organisations and receiving director's fees)It makes their promises and support feel vulgar. If all it takes is $300 to buy loyalty from Singaporeans, we do deserve the predicament we find ourselves in.Edit : I found this article that explains what their roles are since so many asking.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2020/11/27/waste-of-taxpayers-money-netizens-question-difference-between-role-of-mayors-and-mps/](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2020/11/27/waste-of-taxpayers-money-netizens-question-difference-between-role-of-mayors-and-mps/)Speaking on a Mayor’s role, Ms Low said that it is similar to “leading a middle office where crucial goals and plans are set to meet the needs on the frontline, and also having to ensure all the back-end processes are in place too”He spoke to CNA journalist Cindy Co on certain lesser-known aspects of the mayor’s role such as needing to build relationships with the community, having “pulse checks” and an “intimate understanding” of the community’s needs.Ms Low explained the CDC’s duties are based on two sets of “ABCs”: Firstly, “Assist the needy, Bond the people and Connect the community”. Secondly, “Aggregate resources, Build capabilities, and again Connect the community”.“A lot of our work takes place behind the scenes, like aggregating, convening and putting together of resources to meet needs, and while this is not highly visible, it is important because it shapes the output and the co-creation of solutions,” he told CNA.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_After reading I still dunno what they do.

So I am going to summerise from the comments that made the most sense to my question here for easy future reference.     ""They operate under the guise of legitimate religious practices. When their questionable activities are challenged, they often deflect criticism by framing it as an attack on religion itself.Given the sensitivity surrounding religious beliefs, this tactic effectively shields them from scrutiny. As long as they remain within certain boundaries, religion can become a convenient cover for financial gain."" - BubbleMikeTea""(for breach of trust) In the case of religious leaders it would be like telling the followers that they need to give money to improve church facilities but using the money to buy a house for themselves.If a leader were to very directly say that money is to be given to him to buy a nice house so that it reflects how well the church is doing, and people are gullible enough to do that, there’s no crime."" - Available\_Ad9766""I think the root cause of this problem is not lack of law banning them — but that so many people are vulnerable and susceptible to cults and marketing tactics, ripe for the picking. For scammers too.Modern society can be so isolating even in adulthood, and there’s not a lot of education on mental health and self-awareness in raising our children. There are so many parents who dismiss their own emotions and their children’s. So when some cult salesperson give validation, they enjoy the sense of belonging."" -Fearless\_Carrot\_7351""There’s already a law that’s why those involved went to jail, no? You can introduce laws but that doesn’t prevent crime from happening. The government has laws against theft, yet people still commit theft"" - kaptainkrispyskin""Because of the size of the congregation, they become vote banks for the ruling party.  Unfortunately it is not a crime to fool the gullible when it comes to faith. Whether he parts with his wealth or sells his HDB flat to finance the pastor’s wife’s record sales is inconsequential.

So I am going to summerise from the comments that made the most sense to my question here for easy future reference.     ""They operate under the guise of legitimate religious practices. When their questionable activities are challenged, they often deflect criticism by framing it as an attack on religion itself.Given the sensitivity surrounding religious beliefs, this tactic effectively shields them from scrutiny. As long as they remain within certain boundaries, religion can become a convenient cover for financial gain."" - BubbleMikeTea""(for breach of trust) In the case of religious leaders it would be like telling the followers that they need to give money to improve church facilities but using the money to buy a house for themselves.If a leader were to very directly say that money is to be given to him to buy a nice house so that it reflects how well the church is doing, and people are gullible enough to do that, there’s no crime."" - Available\_Ad9766""I think the root cause of this problem is not lack of law banning them — but that so many people are vulnerable and susceptible to cults and marketing tactics, ripe for the picking. For scammers too.Modern society can be so isolating even in adulthood, and there’s not a lot of education on mental health and self-awareness in raising our children. There are so many parents who dismiss their own emotions and their children’s. So when some cult salesperson give validation, they enjoy the sense of belonging."" -Fearless\_Carrot\_7351""There’s already a law that’s why those involved went to jail, no? You can introduce laws but that doesn’t prevent crime from happening. The government has laws against theft, yet people still commit theft"" - kaptainkrispyskin""Because of the size of the congregation, they become vote banks for the ruling party.  Unfortunately it is not a crime to fool the gullible when it comes to faith. Whether he parts with his wealth or sells his HDB flat to finance the pastor’s wife’s record sales is inconsequential. The best one can do it make sure your family does not into this trap."" - MolassesBulky""As long as humanity has the fear of the unknown like death there will always be religion and superstition believers.So just Live and let live.

Here is the English translation below (Google but with some minor edits):===========  The local historic Tanglin Club was exposed for having an unhealthy working environment. When the former general manager resigned, he revealed that he had witnessed and experienced many incidents of workplace bullying and harassment during his time of over three years at the club. He was also publicly insulted by members of the management committee at a meeting.After investigating and confirming the relevant incidents and allegations, the investigation team set up by the club issued an investigation report to members and made detailed recommendations on the work culture. However, the recommendations have been issued for a long time, and anonymous members pointed out that the club seems to have no intention of implementing the recommendations. After several months, there is still ""no movement"", and the current work environment is still full of the unhealthy culture that existed before.According to information obtained by Channel 8, the club's investigation team particularly emphasized in its report that the club does have an unhealthy work culture, and made detailed suggestions on how to improve it. These included establishing a clear ""management structure"" to distinguish the powers of the general manager and the president; dividing the scope of the club's management and operations; and clearly distinguishing the responsibilities of the general manager and the president.In addition, the panel also believes that ""selecting the right people to join the board of directors"" is crucial. The report said that the club has about 4,000 members, but only about 300 people vote in each board of directors election. The panel condemned the ""non-interference"" attitude of most club members, and the fact that the board of directors has always been composed of older men. It is recommended that ""more women and young members should be actively attracted to run for the board of directors"" to contribute to the club.# Former general manager: Workplace bullying and harassment occurred at the clubDavid Brightling, the former general manager of Tanglin Club who has already left the club, revealed in his resignation report that during his more than three years at Tanglin Club, he witnessed and encountered many incidents of workplace bullying and harassment, and bluntly stated that the club's work culture was unhealthy.He also specifically pointed out that he was verbally abused by members at a meeting at the end of June 2023, which was the worst he had ever experienced. However, he also said that it was not the only factor that prompted him to leave. In addition to the unhealthy work culture, he revealed that other clubs had poached him to join.According to LinkedIn, a social job search website, Brightling was the general manager of the Tanglin Club since October 2021, but resigned in January 2024. Currently, he is the general manager of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong.Tanglin Club seems to be in constant turmoil. Two members who reportedly witnessed the former general manager being verbally abused have submitted a campaign form, expressing their intention to run in the club's new year's management committee election.However, their eligibility to run for election was subsequently questioned by other members, and the club also found that their election forms were not qualified, so it decided to cancel their candidacy.The two members were said to be dissatisfied with the decision and subsequently hired a lawyer to seek a legal challenge. The club's management committee eventually rejected the challenge on the advice of the club's lawyer, but paradoxically, the club took the initiative to express its willingness to pay the two members' S$40,000 legal fees.This move by the club has caused dissatisfaction among many members. They questioned why the club, since it had rejected their challenge, would actively express its willingness to pay for the lawyer's fees.
