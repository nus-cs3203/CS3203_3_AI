t3_s4kdva,For those that want tips on how to cope with depression or want to know what Singapore's mental healthcare system is like,"Hey all. 20M Singaporean here, have been coping with depression for the past 3 years. Here are some ways that helped me cope. I will just get straight to the tips, if you are interested in my back story or want to know the process of getting referred to IMH to read on.If you don't want to read this, here's the most important part. **You can only rely on yourself.**Tip 1: Don't rely on friends.Don't get me wrong, you can talk to your friends about your troubles and spend time with them to distract yourself. At the end of the day, you can only help yourself. They will not be there for you forever and friends come and go. They wouldn't want to keep someone who always talks about negative things around them.Tip 2: Listen to music.I'm sure we've all done this; lying down on your bed, staring at your ceiling and overthinking. Play some music. Just be sure not to play any music that's associated with bad memories. Finding new songs or genres of music really lifts your mood and gets your mind off the painful thoughts.Tip 3: Learn an instrument.I know this isn't for everyone but learning a new instrument can help pass time. Seeing your effort come to fruition is really satisfying and honestly makes you feel a lot better.Tip 4: Play with your pets.I'm sure there are some scientific studies that show that playing with your pets can help improve your mood. I didn't really look it up but personally it really helped.Tip 5: Take walks or just relax outdoors alone.Going out to the beach or somewhere quiet is really refreshing, especially after spending all that time cooped up in your room. You can bring your instrument along as well :).Tip 6: Talk to your parents.I know this may not be an option for everyone out there, but if you are lucky to have this as an option then please do so. Some parents may not understand what you are going through, but at least you're not bottling up everything. If you can't talk to your parents, try finding a psychologist (which is pretty hard here in Sg).Tip 7: Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.Having a drink now and then and crying really helps. But don't overdo it on the drinking, you'll only develop dependence, and same goes for the drugs (obviously).For those that are lucky enough to have not experienced depression, this is what it's like. Everyday waking up seems like a chore. You don't have motivation to do the simplest things like washing up or eating. You just want to lay in bed and close your eyes. You don't look forward to anything, not even your hobbies or playing games. You just don't have to will to do anything. You lose appetite, you want less human interaction and you just feel like fucking shit. I'm writing this to help those of you out there that feel the same way.Okay, now that I have laid out the groundwork for what I'm going to say, here is how I've learnt these tips. If you were just here for the tips you don't have to read on, but if you are interested on how the mental healthcare scene is in Singapore I will touch on that.I'm going to make this short, so I don't catch myself ruminating about my bad times. I was left out and bullied in secondary school leading to super low self-esteem. Was never invited to birthday parties or anything of the sort, not even hangouts at the nearby mall. I was lucky enough to be oblivious to how I was being treated by my ""friends"" though, so I don't think this played a huge part in my circumstance.Entered polytechnic, found my first actual group of friends and a girlfriend. We broke up shortly after getting together, later found out that she cheated on me with her ex. Being young and immature I started spiraling downwards into depression, drinking everyday, self harming etc. Lost interest in everything, basketball, studies, going out with friends, everything... Now that I look back it was really stupid of me. Almost jumped off a 25-storey building, later found out that my ex and her bf were making fun of me on social media for doing so. Fast forward about half a year later, found a new girlfriend and felt a lot better. My group of friends started falling apart because of small little arguments, only hung out with one or two friends. When I saw that the relationship was failing, started getting depressed and doing the same stupid things minus the suicide part. And to top it off, I fell out with my only friends in poly. Soon after, I broke up with my gf. I had no friends, no girlfriend. I decided to apply for deferment, which in my case was around 4 months or 1 semester. I went to see the doctor to get referred to IMH for depression. I'll touch on this part later, it's pretty important and i'm sure some of you are wondering what it would be like to be referred to IMH.During my deferment I thought it was a good idea to reconnect with my old secondary school friends. Everything was cool for the first month or so until they started to drift. I saw them as a distraction and it worked well while it lasted. Nobody really cared about how I just broke up or how I was feeling down 24/7. Soon after, I made some friends who were honestly of bad influence, started taking drugs and the sorts. After I cut everybody off, I went back to school, alone. As a retainee, nobody talked to me, I just went to school, sat through lessons and went home. It's pretty sad but I was fine with it.Here is where I tell you what I've learnt. Friends are a great distraction and nothing else. You can't rely on them, you can only rely on yourself. Sure, you can tell them about your problems, cry to them or spend time together. But at the end of the day, **you really have to reflect on yourself and stop moping around.** They have their own lives too, and they can't always be there when you need someone even though you were there for them when they did. Whenever any one of my friends was feeling down, I would drive over to their place and give them company. I did this countless times. But when I really needed somebody, no matter who I called, nobody would pick up. Nobody would care that I was feeling down. I don't blame them, I just wish that I cared about myself more. Now I wonder why I spent so much time and effort caring about others when really I should've been taking care of myself, though it would've been nice if they reciprocated. Don't get me wrong, you can cry and talk to your friends as much as your want, but don't expect anyone to be there for you when you really need someone, even for those who claim that they care. Friends come and go, that's just how it is.After realizing this I decided to cut contact with everyone, except those that were still worth talking to.Yes, it is lonely. Very lonely. Most of the time I would wake up with no notifications on my phone, no one talking to me, no one asking if I wanted dinner that night. I don't even have friends to play games with. But I've been caring for myself, making sure that I'm setting myself up for the future, when I actually enter adulthood.One more thing. Sure, you can smoke or drink, but do so in regulation. Trust me, if you drink yourself to sleep every night, your depression will still be there when you wake up.I abused K2 and weed because I had no one to spend time with. I had no friends, so I would go out alone and take drugs to relax and enjoy my alone time. Luckily for me, I didn't take anything more serious and it was just a phase. Once I stopped taking them and faced my problems straight up, I didn't want to go back to taking them. Although it does help you relax and get rid of your problems, it's only temporary. And it could lead to drug addiction. Nobody wants that.Okay here's the more interesting part. Singapore's mental healthcare. Here is what I did to get referred to IMH. I may not remember everything in detail. I went to a private clinic and told him I was showing symptoms of depression. He would write a letter and then you would go to a polyclinic to have a psychiatrist have a look at you. If they think that you should be admitted to IMH, then they would write another letter and you would have to take it there. This process takes around 3-4 months. If I remember correctly, you have to go for multiple assessments. Meaning that they would ask you the same questions as: ""How is your mood? How is your appetite? Have you lost interest in your hobbies?""The sad thing is that these psychiatrists aren't there to listen to your problems and give you advice. They are just there to assess you. Once you go through the multiple assessments, they will schedule an appointment for you at IMH. The waiting time is at least 1-2 months. During your first appointment, the doctor has access to the information that they collected from the assessments, and they will prescribe antidepressants. You have to return every 7 weeks (I think?) to refill your medication. And yes you have to pay, I was on 3 different types of medication at one point, each visit would cost me about $200. The sad thing is that throughout this entire process, unless you see a private psychologist costs $300+ per session, they will only refer you to one after your first appointment at IMH. And then you have to wait at least another month or two for your appointment. So throughout this entire 6 month-ish process, they only assess you and give you medicine. In other words, they just do their job. There is no therapy whatsoever. I didn't bother to go for the psychologist appointments because they just took so long.And here is another story to top it off. There was a period of time, quite recently in fact, where I was really down in the dumps and felt like I was going to do something stupid (off myself), so I drove to IMH A&amp;E to talk to a doctor or something. I understand that there are people out there with schizophrenia or more serious mental problems, but when I went there and told the front counter that I was afraid that I was going to do something dumb, I had to wait at least 3 hours before being able to see a doctor. You had to wait at the waiting area for 3 hours. I just took more drugs lol. Not even IMH A&amp;E can help you, unless you are willing to wait 3 hours or more, but if you're suicidal I don't think you would wait 3 hours.I've stopped taking the medication for about a week now. I do not have friends to rely on, I only have myself. I know hearing me saying you can only rely on yourself is sickening but trust me, take care of yourself. The only people that will take care of you are your parents or your maybe your significant other. Not even IMH cares.If you have any questions do leave them in the comments :).Edit:Thank you all for the comments and suggestions.

t3_tnn8yk,Strange scam involving leaked data (?),"My legal name has the format [Surname] [Chinese name], [Western name]. This will be important. Yesterday afternoon I received a call from a +65 number. Knowing that it's a scam, I picked it up anyway to be greeted by a human speaking Mandarin, claiming to be from MOH, who addressed me using the format [Surname] [Chinese name]. This was especially interesting considering a few factors: government officials typically speak English and would address me by [Western name] [Surname], no one addresses me by my Chinese name because they **will** get it wrong the first try, and the scammer used my dialect surname instead of using the Mandarin reading of my surname. For this reason I use my Chinese name as a shibboleth because it is so difficult even actual Chinese native speakers might get it wrong the first try, meaning that friends no matter where they are from will always try to use my Western name. Even online my name formats are either [Western name] [Surname] or [Surname] [Chinese name] (,) [Western name]. So I went on the offensive by pointedly asking it ""What is my full name then?"" in Mandarin, but it kept dodging the question. After a lot of persuasion I managed to get my name spelt out *but without the Western name*. I kept telling it that the name is still incomplete and kept putting on the pressure to spell out my full name, because [Surname] [Chinese name] alone is not my full name. The scammer kept dodging the question until it lost patience and asked me if I wanted to hear it say my IC number, which made it even more intriguing. After accepting the challenge, the scammer said an IC number that actually got everything correct *except for one number*. And it's a number that would indicate which year I was born in. Now here's the question: assuming the IC number is actually scraped correctly but recited wrongly (the wrong number would have been invalid due to the wrong checksum anyway), how did they get only my Chinese name, yet not get my surname in Mandarin correct (meaning they did not get my name in hanzi).

t3_vi3ez8,"Migrant worker advocate who did not get work pass renewed made misleading, false public posts: MOM"," SINGAPORE - A migrant worker who was active in local literary circles and founded two community groups here has left Singapore after his work permit expired and was not renewed.In a Facebook post on Wednesday (June 22), Mr Zakir Hossain Khokan, 43, said the system had initially reflected an ""adverse record with a government agency"".He was later told that this was an administrative error and that his work permit was ""ineligible"" for renewal, he said.Responding to media queries, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said it takes into account various factors when assessing an applicant's suitability to work in Singapore and for work passes to be renewed.The ministry noted that by Mr Zakir's own account, Singapore has allowed him to work here for 19 years.""Through his time in Singapore, he has written often about migrant workers here. We renewed his work pass many times despite his activism and writings,"" said MOM. ""We draw the line, however, when public posts are misleading, false or deliberately provocative.""   ""It cited a Facebook post that Mr Zakir made last October in the wake of unrest at Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory that drew riot police to the scene.Police had responded to a call for assistance at the dorm after a confrontation between workers and management over poor quality food and long delays in transporting workers with Covid-19 to recovery and healthcare facilities.While Special Operations Command officers were on standby, the Ministry of Home Affairs said then that additional police units were not deployed and no arrests were made by the police durting the incident.MOM said Mr Zakir had called migrant workers in Singapore ""work slaves"", and dormitories here ""work camps"", and also alleged that soldiers and armoured vehicles had surrounded the dorm.""This was a false characterisation,"" MOM said. ""There were no soldiers, let alone armoured vehicles, around.""The ministry added that Mr Zakir's statements could have incited migrant workers at the dorm and elsewhere, inflamed their emotions and possibly caused incidents of public disorder.It added: ""The ability of a foreigner to work in Singapore is not an entitlement. Mr Zakir has been permitted to work in Singapore for a long time, though he was a long-time activist.""His work pass has since expired. He cannot prolong his stay when he no longer has a job in Singapore. He has over-stayed his welcome.""The ministry also noted that while Mr Zakir had appealed the decision by the Controller of Work Passes that his work pass was ineligible for renewal, his employer did not appeal.

We renewed his work pass many times despite his activism and writings,"" said MOM. ""We draw the line, however, when public posts are misleading, false or deliberately provocative.""   ""It cited a Facebook post that Mr Zakir made last October in the wake of unrest at Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory that drew riot police to the scene.Police had responded to a call for assistance at the dorm after a confrontation between workers and management over poor quality food and long delays in transporting workers with Covid-19 to recovery and healthcare facilities.While Special Operations Command officers were on standby, the Ministry of Home Affairs said then that additional police units were not deployed and no arrests were made by the police durting the incident.MOM said Mr Zakir had called migrant workers in Singapore ""work slaves"", and dormitories here ""work camps"", and also alleged that soldiers and armoured vehicles had surrounded the dorm.""This was a false characterisation,"" MOM said. ""There were no soldiers, let alone armoured vehicles, around.""The ministry added that Mr Zakir's statements could have incited migrant workers at the dorm and elsewhere, inflamed their emotions and possibly caused incidents of public disorder.It added: ""The ability of a foreigner to work in Singapore is not an entitlement. Mr Zakir has been permitted to work in Singapore for a long time, though he was a long-time activist.""His work pass has since expired. He cannot prolong his stay when he no longer has a job in Singapore. He has over-stayed his welcome.""The ministry also noted that while Mr Zakir had appealed the decision by the Controller of Work Passes that his work pass was ineligible for renewal, his employer did not appeal. The appeal was considered and MOM informed him that it was unsuccessful.A former freelance journalist and poet, Mr Zakir returned to his home in Bangladesh on June 15 after working in Singapore's construction sector for nearly two decades.During his time here, he founded literary interest group Migrant Writers of Singapore and started ""One Bag, One Book"", a book-sharing project for foreign workers here that later helped to distribute supplies to migrant workers living in dorms when Covid-19 struck.Mr Zakir took the first prize for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 in the Migrant Worker Poetry Competition organised by Banglar Kantha, a newspaper here for the Bangladeshi community.Mr Zakir said in his Facebook post that he received notice from his employer's human resources department on May 24 that his work permit could not be renewed.""I went to my site office and realised that I couldn't access the building.

t3_vr2mmx,Any recommendations for psychologist/psychiatrist in the East? (For depression),"Hi everyone, asking for a friend here. Friend is going through an ugly divorce and have recently reached out regarding suspicions that she is experiencing signs of depression. If I understand it correctly I believe if we lookup the psych registry, they only list names of consultant individual so it is difficult to find out who actually specialises in depression etc.. Personally I don’t know anyone that might be helpful so hoping this subreddit can help.

t3_xyu006,The astronomical increase in 3 room resale prices in the 4 cheapest non-mature estates from '19 to '22 vs wage growth for youths and seniors from '19 to '21,"We are concerned with small resale flats because they provide immediate housing to young couples, especially crucial for those planning on having children, and for singles 35 and over. They serve as a benchmark on how affordable it is to get married/have children.**Key takeaway**For the cheapest non-mature estates of Woodlands, Bukit Batok, Jurong West, and Yishun, prices rose from $240,000, $258,000, $260,000, and $260,000 in Q2 2019 to $337,000, $345,000, $340,000, and $360,000 in Q2 2022. That's an increase of 40.1%, 33.7%, 30.7%, and 38.4%! (I picked 4 instead of 3 because the 3rd place was tied in 2019.)Edit: a dual citizen couple earning $5,000 and not staying near parents would get $95,000 in grants. After 95k in grants, a three room flat at the median price in Jurong West and Woodlands, which had the smallest and largest increase in prices, would be $163,000 and $145,000, and $250,000 and $242,000 in 2019 and 2022 respectively. This is a **53.4% and 66.9%** increase respectively, which also applies for your monthly loan repayments! The repayments for a maximum 25 year HDB loan went from $592 and $526 for Jurong West and Woodlands to $907 and $878! That's more than the cost of infant care after subsidies ($264)! While this is still below the 30% of monthly pay threshold, shouldn't we be alarmed by the dramatic increase? **Wage growth in youth?**However, the wage growth from June 2019 to June 2021 for youth below 35 (excluding NSFs, full-time employed only, including CPF) was negative to negligible, which is a very different image from the overall median wage growth. Those from 55-59 had significantly higher wage growth. Therefore housing has been even more unaffordable for young couples than those who have been just become able to start withdrawing from CPF. And now, the prices of the most affordable small resale flats will likely rise even further than 5 room and larger because of the loophole for those who are above 55 being allowed buy a resale immediately without having to rent/move in with relatives for 15 months in the new restrictions on private to non-subsidised resale downgraders.From ages 20-24, 25-30, and 30-34, the median wage was respectively $2,730, $4,081 and $5,197 in 2019, and $2,691, $4,095, $5,222 in 2021. This was a change of -1.42%, 0.34%, and 0.48%.This contrasts with the 2.56% increase in overall median monthly income from $4,563 to S$4,680 over the same period.**Wage growth in seniors and consequences for the loophole**What about those able to take advantage of the loophole in the new regulations? Those aged 55-59 had their wages grow from $3,563 to $3,729, or 4.66%. That's 82.0% higher than the overall median monthly income growth.Those over 60 had their wages fall from $2,562 to $2,543, or -0.74%. That's around half the percentage loss than those from 20-24. Therefore, since those from 55-59 had wage growth nearly double of wage growth across all ages, shouldn't the loophole be at least limited to those over 60? **Conclusion and disclaimer**The resale prices for 3 room flats in non-mature estates have grown by much more since before the pandemic compared to wages across the youngest and oldest age groups, which have remained flat or even fallen.While the calculations for the increase in resale prices at the start of the post included an additional year of increase compared to the wage growth data, the extent of total increase deserves to be calculated. And I'm too tired from typing this from my phone already to take the 2021 Q2 resale data and compare the increase between both 2019 and 2022.Edit: only a few estates are offered BTO every quarter and the attractiveness of the developments vary. New flats made available after MOP would significantly change prices that quarter and afterwards. I could have used an average of Q1 and Q2 prices to smooth that out, which is more important than matching the Q2 prices with the June wage levels.Compound annual growth rate might have been a better option instead of a simple percentage growth over the initial value, I'm not sure.

t3_zbaov4,Housing Supply and Price: 4-Room HDB Flats Completed vs Price Per Sqm over time,"[4 Room Flats completed and Median Price PSQM of 4 Room Flats over time, updated with vertical axis labels](https://preview.redd.it/a0f8og2uon3a1.jpg?width=1526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b4685ff4436077be914806c2442b9dcecfa227)I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/yh4xyv/number_of_flats_completed_annually_source_singstat/) and decided to look at the numbers as well. The graph above charts the number of 4-Room flats that were completed in each year, against the median per-square-metre (PSQM) price of 4-Room flats in that year.I used PSQM price to account for changes to the sizes of flats over the years, and restricted this graph to only 4-Room flats for ease of analysis, and because they are the most common flat type.These are my thoughts about the graph:# From 1990 to 1997There was an incredible property price increase from 1992–1997 (from 909 to 3120 = 243%!), right before the Asian Financial Crisis. This was also followed by the oft-mentioned “oversupply of houses” which led to the creation of the BTO system in 2002.Although the number of flats completed went up similarly in this time as well, house prices could not be tamed so quickly, probably because:* regulations on buying houses were far, far looser back then (e.g., whether or not I like the MOP, MOP on resale flats was **MUCH** shorter then (can’t find exactly); looser loan restrictions; **no ABSD**), and* there was probably an “irrationally exuberant” rush to buy houses then.# From 1998 to 2017Flats completed fell off a cliff from 1998–2002 and stayed low till 2010. Prices for flats gradually trended upwards from 2002–2007, then increased 87% (from 2537 to 4747) from 2007–2013. Anyone around at the time would remember the general dissatisfaction from the population from concerns of overcrowding, which commentators said was related to PAP’s poorest electoral results in GE2011.There is always a delay in housing development, which is why they are seen as cyclical markets all across the world (when prices go up, developers rush to build, and when they’re all done 3 years later, the sudden flood of units make prices go down, so developers build less, etc … ). This partially explains why it took even the big G 6 years (from 2007–2013) to tame housing prices.This could be exacerbated by a BTO system which explicitly avoids building ahead. Even if HDB ramped up BTO launches in 2008, when flat prices began to make intimidating advances, they would only be completed around 2011 (3 years later, which was roughly the standard at the time).There was a spike in 4-Room flats built in 2011, but it dropped down low in 2012 and 2013 again, only rising up again in 2014. Comparing this to the graph in the previous post, while the number of flats built in 2012 was roughly the same as in 2011, there was a dip in the total number in 2013 in any case. That being the case, it’s fair to guess that HDB probably didn’t go pedal-to-the-metal in launching flats in 2007–2008 (couldn’t find BTO launch data), and only started pushing out more flats around or after 2010, resulting in the bumper crop of flats completed from 2014–2017.This bumper crop of flats barely made a dent in housing prices either, which is indicative of the ‘stickiness’ of house prices in Singapore. Since flats are mostly owner-occupied, most have no urgent need to sell the flats; they can stay in it long term and hold out for a better price.# from 2018 to presentFlats completed fell off a cliff (again) in 2018 (nicely marking 20 years after 1998), dropping further through to 2020, until an uptick in 2021. I’m not sure why the number of 4-Room flats completed from 2018–2020 fell so much, or if any policy reason was ever made public. The overall trend matches that of the total number of flats completed, so it’s not specific to 4-Room flats either.Meanwhile, we know what’s been going on in the housing market since 2020: 26 consecutive months of resale HDB price increases, rental price increases that defy gravity and all sensible expectations, and so on.But what is clear is: 2018–2020 blue line down, 2020–2021 orange line up.# other interesting thingsThe price increases from 2007–2013 were practically independent of the Global Financial Crisis (2008 Recession), which may show that our HDB prices are pretty insulated from the rest of the world — this makes sense, because they are public housing and the Government retains significant control over the market.But this also means that the Government could probably build more houses to meet demand, earlier, rather than let us watch the HDB price go up to the moon. It’s not just some COVID-induced WFH or moving-out demand driving up prices now; it’s at least equally a supply problem.Additionally, it’s pretty important to notice that these PSQM prices are for **resale** flats.

The graph above charts the number of 4-Room flats that were completed in each year, against the median per-square-metre (PSQM) price of 4-Room flats in that year.I used PSQM price to account for changes to the sizes of flats over the years, and restricted this graph to only 4-Room flats for ease of analysis, and because they are the most common flat type.These are my thoughts about the graph:# From 1990 to 1997There was an incredible property price increase from 1992–1997 (from 909 to 3120 = 243%!), right before the Asian Financial Crisis. This was also followed by the oft-mentioned “oversupply of houses” which led to the creation of the BTO system in 2002.Although the number of flats completed went up similarly in this time as well, house prices could not be tamed so quickly, probably because:* regulations on buying houses were far, far looser back then (e.g., whether or not I like the MOP, MOP on resale flats was **MUCH** shorter then (can’t find exactly); looser loan restrictions; **no ABSD**), and* there was probably an “irrationally exuberant” rush to buy houses then.# From 1998 to 2017Flats completed fell off a cliff from 1998–2002 and stayed low till 2010. Prices for flats gradually trended upwards from 2002–2007, then increased 87% (from 2537 to 4747) from 2007–2013. Anyone around at the time would remember the general dissatisfaction from the population from concerns of overcrowding, which commentators said was related to PAP’s poorest electoral results in GE2011.There is always a delay in housing development, which is why they are seen as cyclical markets all across the world (when prices go up, developers rush to build, and when they’re all done 3 years later, the sudden flood of units make prices go down, so developers build less, etc … ). This partially explains why it took even the big G 6 years (from 2007–2013) to tame housing prices.This could be exacerbated by a BTO system which explicitly avoids building ahead. Even if HDB ramped up BTO launches in 2008, when flat prices began to make intimidating advances, they would only be completed around 2011 (3 years later, which was roughly the standard at the time).There was a spike in 4-Room flats built in 2011, but it dropped down low in 2012 and 2013 again, only rising up again in 2014. Comparing this to the graph in the previous post, while the number of flats built in 2012 was roughly the same as in 2011, there was a dip in the total number in 2013 in any case. That being the case, it’s fair to guess that HDB probably didn’t go pedal-to-the-metal in launching flats in 2007–2008 (couldn’t find BTO launch data), and only started pushing out more flats around or after 2010, resulting in the bumper crop of flats completed from 2014–2017.This bumper crop of flats barely made a dent in housing prices either, which is indicative of the ‘stickiness’ of house prices in Singapore. Since flats are mostly owner-occupied, most have no urgent need to sell the flats; they can stay in it long term and hold out for a better price.# from 2018 to presentFlats completed fell off a cliff (again) in 2018 (nicely marking 20 years after 1998), dropping further through to 2020, until an uptick in 2021. I’m not sure why the number of 4-Room flats completed from 2018–2020 fell so much, or if any policy reason was ever made public. The overall trend matches that of the total number of flats completed, so it’s not specific to 4-Room flats either.Meanwhile, we know what’s been going on in the housing market since 2020: 26 consecutive months of resale HDB price increases, rental price increases that defy gravity and all sensible expectations, and so on.But what is clear is: 2018–2020 blue line down, 2020–2021 orange line up.# other interesting thingsThe price increases from 2007–2013 were practically independent of the Global Financial Crisis (2008 Recession), which may show that our HDB prices are pretty insulated from the rest of the world — this makes sense, because they are public housing and the Government retains significant control over the market.But this also means that the Government could probably build more houses to meet demand, earlier, rather than let us watch the HDB price go up to the moon. It’s not just some COVID-induced WFH or moving-out demand driving up prices now; it’s at least equally a supply problem.Additionally, it’s pretty important to notice that these PSQM prices are for **resale** flats. Prices continue to rise although all resale flats in Singapore are aging and have a gradually dwindling number of years left on their lease.# closing thoughtsSingapore’s Government and HDB is in a fairly special position worldwide, in having such control over the supply of housing.

t3_zet1xb,"Success, expectations, shame, and humiliation in (Singapore) society","I read what u/kernelrider had written in his posting [""Unpopular Opinion: Singapore wastes human capital of our youth and sets us up to fail""](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zdpl85/unpopular_opinion_singapore_wastes_human_capital/) and felt like he touched on a number of issues outside what he was advocating for.  These issues affect us all, but especially more so for Singaporeans due to our more conservative cultural upbringings.Before I start, I don't think people hate you, r/kernelrider. As others have pointed out, you could've more eloquently pointed out your concerns and decoupled them with your other opinions.  For the most part, I actually don't think you're logically wrong with your opinions either, especially since I've felt similarly to you at different points of my life.  In fact, I suspect that most of us here have, perhaps at different levels.  But, crucially, I think with time and experience many of us see things differently, and this might be useful to consider.(Quick disclaimer: I'm in tech, so many of the examples/analogies are in tech)**Success as the 1%**First, from young, like much of our Asian brethren in academically focused countries like Japan or South Korea, we are taught that academic excellence leads to success.  We all know this - if not from our parents, our academic system focuses on highlighting those who are bright and successful.  ""Ya my daughter got into Raffles! What about your son?""The flip side of glorifying success is shame for not living up to the expectations of your family, your peers, or society.**The 0.01% of the 1%**The truth is, even if you manage to get into some top Primary School, tertiary school, or post-secondary school, the cycle repeats. Your peers are now the smartest in the country, in your city, your state, etc.  Every bit of differentiation helps, every advantage does too.  From one Harvard/Ivy League/NUS student to another: ""So what are you studying? Oh that's good. You're applying to Google?  That's great!  I am too!""When you start competing against the best, even those who have been blessed in different ways will realize what almost everyone does (except the 0.00000001%).  *Life is not fair*.The primary school student who doesn't have both parents may envy the students that have both parents and more financial ability, and the extra tutoring that may have been a factor in these other students making it to a higher tier Sec school.  The ACS students who are the envy of many may be envious of the geniuses of their classes who do well and seem set to make it to a JC of their choice.  Those in RI may feel envious of their peers who have the financial and emotional support of their families to apply to prestigious universities outside of Singapore.It doesn't stop there.  When you're looking to over-achieve like u/kernelrider seems to be, compared to the students from other countries, Singapore + NS + its drawbacks seem to accumulate.  I have several concrete examples of how being Singaporean has negatively affected my options and potential for climbing certain ladders of success.  I mean this sincerely when I say I do not hate what's happened, and am pointing them out because I think I understand the frustrations he is sharing.**The 0.01% of the 0.01% of the 1%**If the goal is to be exceptional, however, being elite isn't enough.  You're from MIT?  You've got a Masters?  A PhD?  Who's your supervisor?  How many citations do you have? Oh, you work in Amazon?  What team?  What roles?  What impact?  Who knows your name?How many of the 150,000 Alphabet (Google's parent company) employees are well known to everyone?  How many in each of the big companies?  You're in McKinsey?  What's your specialization?  How many associates make it to Partner?**Becoming Exceptional**Let me preface this: I am not exceptional.  I'm not famous either - if you knew my name, you won't know anything about me.  Outside of a small bubble of people, I am unremarkable.But like **most** of you, I've chased success within my realm of imagination, capability, and effort.  Yes, life is not fair.  But you're dealt your hand, so the real question is: **what do you choose to do?**The world is full of people who made the choice to spend less time at the office and more time at home.  Many make that choice to be happy, knowing that they may lose out for opportunities.  This happens at different stages of life, even at the different levels of schooling.That same bell curve you might want to use to describe success financially across entire demographic sections of society exists within each tier of company or role/occupation.  Going back to the example of top tech companies.  Of the 221k Microsoft employees, despite them all perhaps being elite when they first joined, are they all equally productive?  Exceptional?  No, many are happy to be there, and are happy to have a life that doesn't involve a 9-9, 6 day week.Of course, there are those who do 80 hour weeks.  Effort can be a factor in helping someone stand out, but it's not the only one.  Often, standing out is a choice, and one that requires more effort, talent, capability, etc.I think a main point I've seen, time over time, is this: **being exceptional has a lot more to do with what you do** than it does with the opportunities you might miss.  Life is not fair, and the vast majority of people, Singaporean or not, have a mix of advantages and disadvantages compared to one another.  Sometimes these differences are not exploited.  Sometimes they don't matter.Here are some more concrete examples.  What matters more to an ultra-elite internship?  The two years and four months a peer has on your in age because of NS, or the fact that you built some app at a hackathon, polished it up, and benefitted some community with it when your peers didn't?  Want to be the grad student of an ultra-famous professor? How does tutoring to get better marks at Uni matter, compared with a plethora of notes, read articles, and demonstrated work in the field of the prof's study?You might think: this guy says he's not exceptional, so how can he claim that these are more effective tradeoffs?  One, it's logical.  Two, it's lived.  I'm not exceptional because I don't push the ""TURBO"" button all the time, but in some situations, I have, and have been far more effective than my peers at getting the outcomes I want.**It Never Ends**The problem with being exceptional is there's always another level.  And you may choose to actively chase it, or subconsciously do so.  You finished your PhD?  What's next?  You become a prof?  Are you well known in the field?  You are now? That's great, but are you impacting the field? Is your research considered seminal? The vast majority of academics will never end up doing and writing about field-impacting research.  And even if you do, what's your next seminal paper?With money, it's the same.  Millionaire?  So what?  Billionaire?  Wow, awesome.  Do you have a plan for setting up your descendants to be successful?  Are you impacting the world enough through your charity work?  Are your investments doing well so that you don't lose your wealth?  If your goal is to be famous and respected, how is that going?If you find joy and happiness in the chase, that's perfectly fine.  But that's not most people, and many won't realize it often until it's too late.  It's why I'm happy for my friends and colleagues who know what they want in life and are happy with where they are.  When you're told that being happy is being successful in the eyes of society, it'll often continue to be an ongoing race that never ends.**FUCK EXPECTATIONS, SHAME, AND HUMILIATION**That's a bit forceful, but the main point.  Your family is going to have expectations of you.  Your peers and society are going to have expectations.  Sure, it's not so easy to ignore them, but until you choose to, and set your own goals and expectations to your own version of success and happiness, you're riding in the currents of an ocean that you do not control.I'm not at all advocating that you give up the chase for what you think is important.  Nor am I suggesting that u/kernelrider not be unhappy, or am I saying ""suck up buttercup"" either.  First, the reality is that most of these disadvantages pale in comparison to your creativity and effort, and that for many of us, **these societal expectations and the feelings that stem from not achieving what is deemed successful is inbuilt and we should be aware that these feelings are manufactured as well**.  The older I got, the more I realized that when I removed each of what others expected of me and what I could do, the happier I was.  It's not to say I gave up on everything society suggestion was necessary to be ""successful"" or ""happy"".  I just chose specific items that mattered to me, and others that don't.  I don't have a new mansion for a home: where I am, it's possible to have one in the middle of nowhere.  I chose a smaller home and have much less financial pressure to keep up with payments.  We don't have jewelry.  I have a used 2nd hand car - it's necessary to have one here, but I could've opted for a flashy new one.  We very rarely travel.Thing is, I think we all know the hands we are dealt, and choose to live life differently.  And many choose the less commonly-perceived routes for ""success"" and ""happiness"".  It's when we do, that shame and humiliation matter less and less.I recently finished my postgrad.  My supervisor?  Much younger.  New profs?  Younger than me.  Should I feel shame or humiliation from that?  Life dealt me the hand that made it difficult to progress straight into grad school.  Should I not instead celebrate that I chose to get into the field more deeply, even if it was later in life?  I understand the shame / humiliation that was brought up in the other post, but...  I also remember being the young punk who first realized that *some of* my older superiors at work weren't any smarter, driven, or more capable than I was.  As someone in the other post put it, it's a marathon, not a sprint, but taking it further, what's your destination, and why do you care about how others are progressing if you're not even going in the same direction?**Benefits of NS and atypical schedules**I know it's cliche to consider challenges/problems as ""opportunities"" or ""benefits"", but in the case of NS *and* the atypical schedules, I think there are a lot of positives.  One that's been echoed by others, but very much the case for me, is that the decision to do Uni was made by a more mature me.  When I got into class I knew I wanted to do really well and NS helped with that.  Did I want to feel like an NCO who had to obey the orders of a freshly minted 2LT?  That situation is not analogous across all of society, but often the reality in structured organizations.  So school *had purpose*, and yes, I partied less because of those experiences, but I also did better.Atypical schedules helped too.  I actually couldn't get into Uni because I lacked a single class that I managed to make up in the months just before Uni started.  Now obviously this might've been just my situation, but I suspect others might've been in the same situation.Perhaps the most important part about atypical schedules is...  Well, the knowledge that nothing needs to be *fixed exactly the way it starts*.  In many cases, nothing is permanent, and schedules especially so.  Want to take a gap term?  If you've lived your entire life bouncing from one activity to another, you're probably so used to the structure that breaking away from it *to your benefit* hasn't crossed your mind in a serious fashion. The experience helped me change up my schedules and I did better as a result of doing so.&lt;END RANT - thanks for sticking around and listening to this ah gong talk&gt;",Public Safety,-0.6,0.9,0.7,0.9998,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zet1xb/success_expectations_shame_and_humiliation_in/,Reddit,2022-12-07 05:27:00,"Success, expectations, shame, and humiliation in (Singapore) society I read what u/kernelrider had written in his posting [""Unpopular Opinion: Singapore wastes human capital of our youth and sets us up to fail""](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zdpl85/unpopular_opinion_singapore_wastes_human_capital/) and felt like he touched on a number of issues outside what he was advocating for.

Lockdowns in Singapore meant that construction had to pause. Once lockdowns were lifted, safe distancing measures meant less workers can be on site, reducing the amount of work that can be done.

t3_zy1mvb,"Why Singapore homes are so badly designed, in my opinion","Let me preface this, of course there are exceptions, there are plenty of amazing homes. However, I am singling out the bulk of homes and generalising here.**First-time homeowners**Since many Singaporeans have never lived on their own, much less had their own space to curate, there is a general inexperience in designing a space. There is also this overcompensation or overexcitement to do everything and try everything. This inexperience also enables the over-reliance on IDs (interior designers), while there are of course competent ones, many lack formal training or design background and for a lack of a better term “good taste and an eye for design”. They are often over-glorified project managers and often just push the same packages. Foreign homeowners would have lived in many own spaces over the years and have had more time to develop their design style and know how they want to curate the space.**The obsession with built-in everything**I’m not sure where this stems from (if you have any theories please suggest) but I’m sure the above-mentioned IDs have a heavy hand in this, but I noticed Singaporeans love getting things built in. However, the suggested built-ins don’t take into consideration the scale of the space and often are very basic general forms as the common contractor doesn’t really do details or fine finishing. Compared to buying furniture from even a basic shop like Ikea where the designer really takes into consideration the proportion of the finished form. the local ID isn’t really in tune with the nuances, take for example a house tour I watched where the owner complained that the countertops we too Low for her and that she gets backaches from washing plates. Also, too much built-in furniture means that over time the house looks dated and is unable to evolve. A lot of this built-in carpentry that I’ve seen also tends to be super clunky and boxy.**Lack of understanding of user behaviour**As mentioned above, having never lived out on their own, many new homeowners don’t really have time to fully understand their new routines outside of the family home. They don’t design a home around their needs and instead are designing a home around what they think they need. There tends to be either too much storage space or not enough. They might over or underestimate the kitchen appliances they need.**Allergic to colour**I think in general Singaporeans are allergic to colour. Many homes are decked out in neutrals and greys. I think many see this as a shortcut to taste, but rather to me this highlights the lack of it. Singaporeans also shy away from bolder colours like maroon, oranges, emerald greens and amethyst. This isn’t just in the home, but I’ve noticed this recurrence in general architecture in Singapore and even down to local fashions. I think this also stems from the underlying Singapore culture of not wanting to stand out too much and overall conformity. This might be my own personal taste but accent colours even among a sea of beige can really liven things up and add a new level of sophistication.**Not understanding light**A lot of home neglect good lighting. Yes, overhead lights in the brightest white are practical but they do little to set the mood. Accent lights are often an afterthought. A lot of homeowners just rely on large ceiling lights and don’t incorporate lamps. The colour temperature of lights also tends to be neglected.**Copy and pasting**many homeowners on the ID suggestions also just do what is conventional and routine. There is often rarely any originality. Many times aesthetics which are not suited to the space are chosen and then a poor replication is attempted. It’s like seeing the original and then making a knockoff. There is no sin in drawing inspiration from other homes, obviously, however, a lot of contractors don’t do a good job of turning a concept into reality and translating it to the space at hand. Good design is context-based, what may look good in a larger home may be a poor fit for a smaller home, and adaptations and alterations must be carried out for it to make sense.**Doing everything all at once**Since Singaporeans don’t move out at an earlier age, they haven’t accumulated home furnishings over time, slowly refining their taste. Even things like decor items are normally purchased all at the same time, in a matching aesthetic. This may complete the home faster but it lacks real character. There usually aren’t charming stories behind each item, and things are not added in slowly to match the space. This adds to the odd kind of superficial feeling I have noticed in many Singaporean homes, which I see less of in foreign homes. The spaces don’t feel lived in.**Inauthenticity**The copy and pasting and buying a full set of items in a matching aesthetic just somehow creates this impression of inauthenticity which is what I think I take the biggest issue with in most Singapore homes. The houses rarely reflect any character or the personality of their owners, there are no quirks, just a sort of blandness and sameness. It almost feels like a brand-new movie set rather than a home. A lot of homes consequently lack a warmness to them, and I’m not even talking about style here. Even a minimalist or industrial space can be warm and inviting. I think a lot of first-time owners feel pressure to create an instagrammble aesthetically pleasing home, and thus stick to safe and predictable choices on a monochromatic theme rather than thinking outside the box, or creating their own flair and style.**Art is not a consideration**Art also tends to be forgotten. There is usually a lack of any original wall art, or art in general, think of sculptures, pottery or wall hangings. And no, original artwork does not have to be expensive, there is plenty of DIY art you can make in an hour or just browse etsy or local artists. Things like this tend to elevate a home with blank walls. Even well-chosen printed-out stock photos from something like unsplash can be stunning, and printing only costs less than $20.**Constraints**We should also address the HDB is a unique design constraint in Singapore. However, it should not be an excuse. Any space can incorporate good design.**Lack of exposure to good design**I think in general the broad population of Singapore has had limited exposure to good design. It isn’t woven into the fabric of our culture like it is for some others. Understandable since we were a developing country not so long ago, and lofty ideals like design were eschewed for pragmatism and essentials. Hopefully, in time the younger generations will develop a stronger appreciation for design and this will be reflected in future dwellings.",Housing,-0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9985,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zy1mvb/why_singapore_homes_are_so_badly_designed_in_my/,Reddit,2022-12-29 09:58:00,"Why Singapore homes are so badly designed, in my opinion Let me preface this, of course there are exceptions, there are plenty of amazing homes. However, I am singling out the bulk of homes and generalising here.**First-time homeowners**Since many Singaporeans have never lived on their own, much less had their own space to curate, there is a general inexperience in designing a space. There is also this overcompensation or overexcitement to do everything and try everything. This inexperience also enables the over-reliance on IDs (interior designers), while there are of course competent ones, many lack formal training or design background and for a lack of a better term “good taste and an eye for design”. They are often over-glorified project managers and often just push the same packages. Foreign homeowners would have lived in many own spaces over the years and have had more time to develop their design style and know how they want to curate the space.**The obsession with built-in everything**I’m not sure where this stems from (if you have any theories please suggest) but I’m sure the above-mentioned IDs have a heavy hand in this, but I noticed Singaporeans love getting things built in. However, the suggested built-ins don’t take into consideration the scale of the space and often are very basic general forms as the common contractor doesn’t really do details or fine finishing. Compared to buying furniture from even a basic shop like Ikea where the designer really takes into consideration the proportion of the finished form. the local ID isn’t really in tune with the nuances, take for example a house tour I watched where the owner complained that the countertops we too Low for her and that she gets backaches from washing plates. Also, too much built-in furniture means that over time the house looks dated and is unable to evolve. A lot of this built-in carpentry that I’ve seen also tends to be super clunky and boxy.**Lack of understanding of user behaviour**As mentioned above, having never lived out on their own, many new homeowners don’t really have time to fully understand their new routines outside of the family home. They don’t design a home around their needs and instead are designing a home around what they think they need. There tends to be either too much storage space or not enough. They might over or underestimate the kitchen appliances they need.**Allergic to colour**I think in general Singaporeans are allergic to colour. Many homes are decked out in neutrals and greys. I think many see this as a shortcut to taste, but rather to me this highlights the lack of it. Singaporeans also shy away from bolder colours like maroon, oranges, emerald greens and amethyst. This isn’t just in the home, but I’ve noticed this recurrence in general architecture in Singapore and even down to local fashions. I think this also stems from the underlying Singapore culture of not wanting to stand out too much and overall conformity. This might be my own personal taste but accent colours even among a sea of beige can really liven things up and add a new level of sophistication.**Not understanding light**A lot of home neglect good lighting. Yes, overhead lights in the brightest white are practical but they do little to set the mood. Accent lights are often an afterthought. A lot of homeowners just rely on large ceiling lights and don’t incorporate lamps. The colour temperature of lights also tends to be neglected.**Copy and pasting**many homeowners on the ID suggestions also just do what is conventional and routine. There is often rarely any originality. Many times aesthetics which are not suited to the space are chosen and then a poor replication is attempted. It’s like seeing the original and then making a knockoff. There is no sin in drawing inspiration from other homes, obviously, however, a lot of contractors don’t do a good job of turning a concept into reality and translating it to the space at hand. Good design is context-based, what may look good in a larger home may be a poor fit for a smaller home, and adaptations and alterations must be carried out for it to make sense.**Doing everything all at once**Since Singaporeans don’t move out at an earlier age, they haven’t accumulated home furnishings over time, slowly refining their taste. Even things like decor items are normally purchased all at the same time, in a matching aesthetic. This may complete the home faster but it lacks real character. There usually aren’t charming stories behind each item, and things are not added in slowly to match the space. This adds to the odd kind of superficial feeling I have noticed in many Singaporean homes, which I see less of in foreign homes. The spaces don’t feel lived in.**Inauthenticity**The copy and pasting and buying a full set of items in a matching aesthetic just somehow creates this impression of inauthenticity which is what I think I take the biggest issue with in most Singapore homes.

Yet I don't have the data so I went to do some research and here's the findings (i have excluded insignificant train fault) :Nov 15, 2022 (2.5 hours): Signaling fault in North-east line from Boon Keng to Potong Pasir Nov 18, 2022 (no actual data): Power fault in Bukit Panjang LRT, trains moved slowlyNov 23, 2022 (45 mins): Signaling fault in North-east line at Farrer ParkDec 14, 2022 (45 mins): Signaling fault in East West Line, train suspended from Gul Circle to LakesideDec 22, 2022 (15 mins): Signaling fault in Downtown Line from Bukit Panjang to Geylang BahruJan 3, 2022 (1 hour): Signaling fault in North-east line, location not specifiedToday Jan 6, 2022 (2 hours): Signaling fault in Thomson East Coast Line, no train service from stevens to GBTB for an hour, affected the whole line So many signaling fault is not a good sign for MRT system, what's the root cause behind it?

t3_10woy6e,Why garment don't want to review their BTO concept?,"Recently there have been numerous debates about the affordability of HDB, most likely stemming from the high resale price published in the newspaper.However, why garment never stop to think about the high resale price is primarily due to couples not willing to wait 3 to 5 years for BTO? It is a long wait, there isn't many years for young adults. Due to NS, male tend to finish their university at around 24 or 25 and for female around 22 or 23. Asking young adults to wait many years for BTO is a very difficult thing to do. Especially when having a house of their own signify the start of their new life.BTO is a reactive approach towards housing needs with goal to not overburden the financial of the country, especially during financial crisis. However, is such approach really suitable for singapore, evidently with people who not willing to wait thus willing to buy houses at high price?Registration for Flats System (RFS) scheme was the system we used before BTO is introduced. RFS is a pro-active approach to build flat ahead by predicting demands but due to financial crisis in 1997, the demand for housing dropped with oversupply thus BTO is introduced in 2001. Today, BTO evidently is incapable of keeping up with demands thus shouldn't we consider reinstating a revised RFS scheme?We could run RFS and BTO parallel where RFS build ahead with like maybe 33% of the predicted demands then price it such that BTO is lower than RFS. This can better satisfy the needs of different applicants, those who are well off or can't wait can apply for RFS while those who are less well off or can wait will apply for BTO. This also can reduce the chance of overburdening the financial system in the event of financial crisis while also satisfying the needs of the different populations.Edit 1: It is great to see everyone's opinions on this issue. I see some talking about how the past RFS is really like but I would like to clarify I am not saying we should copy and paste the past RFS but rather revise it for today's needs. I mean, it can be named as new scheme called Built-on-sales (BOS).The key takeaway is I think we should have some public housings built ahead, ""some"" because we still need to be mindful that not everyone want housing available relatively soon but we do have people who want it relatively soon. There are people who are willing to pay high price to get it ASAP and current so-called cooling measure doesn't help these people at all. So, having two different schemes will make up for each other weaknesses thus able to serve greater variety of populations' needs and at the same time solving the root cause of the demands which result in a better form of cooling measure.",Housing,-0.7,0.85,0.8,0.9384,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/10woy6e/why_garment_dont_want_to_review_their_bto_concept/,Reddit,2023-02-08 05:58:00,"Why garment don't want to review their BTO concept? Recently there have been numerous debates about the affordability of HDB, most likely stemming from the high resale price published in the newspaper.However, why garment never stop to think about the high resale price is primarily due to couples not willing to wait 3 to 5 years for BTO? It is a long wait, there isn't many years for young adults. Due to NS, male tend to finish their university at around 24 or 25 and for female around 22 or 23. Asking young adults to wait many years for BTO is a very difficult thing to do. Especially when having a house of their own signify the start of their new life.BTO is a reactive approach towards housing needs with goal to not overburden the financial of the country, especially during financial crisis. However, is such approach really suitable for singapore, evidently with people who not willing to wait thus willing to buy houses at high price?Registration for Flats System (RFS) scheme was the system we used before BTO is introduced. RFS is a pro-active approach to build flat ahead by predicting demands but due to financial crisis in 1997, the demand for housing dropped with oversupply thus BTO is introduced in 2001. Today, BTO evidently is incapable of keeping up with demands thus shouldn't we consider reinstating a revised RFS scheme?We could run RFS and BTO parallel where RFS build ahead with like maybe 33% of the predicted demands then price it such that BTO is lower than RFS.

The plastic does not just stay in the sea. It breaks down, releasing greenhouse gases that worsen global warming. It chokes and kills a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals every year.  And ultimately, it breaks down into microplastics and is eaten by fish, crabs, and mussels. This comes back to us on our plates, in our food. It comes back a full circle and our own plastic trash harms us directly. Plastic can no longer be seen just as an environmental problem. It is also a danger to our own health. It must be addressed as an urgent public safety issue.*2) Excessive use of plastic bags are the root of the problem*""We can continue cleaning our shores and continue trapping litter before it enters our waters but we need to move beyond addressing symptoms of the problem. In August, at the Foreign Minister’s meeting in advance of the East Asia Summit, the Ministers noted that one of the root causes of marine plastic debris is the excessive use of plastic bags.

The plastic does not just stay in the sea. It breaks down, releasing greenhouse gases that worsen global warming. It chokes and kills a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals every year.  And ultimately, it breaks down into microplastics and is eaten by fish, crabs, and mussels. This comes back to us on our plates, in our food. It comes back a full circle and our own plastic trash harms us directly. Plastic can no longer be seen just as an environmental problem. It is also a danger to our own health. It must be addressed as an urgent public safety issue.*2) Excessive use of plastic bags are the root of the problem*""We can continue cleaning our shores and continue trapping litter before it enters our waters but we need to move beyond addressing symptoms of the problem. In August, at the Foreign Minister’s meeting in advance of the East Asia Summit, the Ministers noted that one of the root causes of marine plastic debris is the excessive use of plastic bags. That is the root of the problem, which we must tackle in order to successfully combat Marine Plastic Debris.

Hence why the private vehicle population is staying high even though COE prices keep going up.I believe other than how straight Orchard Road is, I think it ought to be a gold (silver?) standard by which more roads should be arranged in the rest of Singapore.It is an incredibly walkable area with plenty of space for pedestrians and cyclists to share side by side, it is well protected from traffic, and there is still space for green verges. One way traffic reduces the likelihood of accidents though I personally would prefer if they depended less on traffic lights and more on winding paths to control speeds. It also forces drivers to plan ahead and be methodical while driving, lowering their speed lest they miss a turn. It also may make it a decision factor to take public transport instead if the route proves to be more of a hassle.Now look at the vast majority of minor roads in heartland areas. 2 way traffic with Singapore's hallmark straight-as-an-arrow roads, with as many lanes squeezed in as possible taking away space from pedestrian footpaths, making it a pain to walk that 2 or 3 bus stops away to the MRT station to save money AND time even though it is not far, much less cycle it.By just taking your typical 6 lane bi-directional road, cutting it down to a one way 3 lane road that turns off both left and right into respective buildings/estates, we can give pedestrians and cyclist so much more space to move around without coming into conflict with each other. Making the roads wind a bit like they did at Hougang St 21 and several Silver zones have also proven to curb speeds and create jutting pockets we can plant bigger trees for shade.I think we have the building blocks to make more non-trunk roads convenient for peds and cyclists, at the expense of drivers if it comes down to it. But it just annoys me that even though there have been initiatives to retrofit some areas as I've mentioned above, a lot of new roads in new estates are still being designed to make driving in and out more convenient than it is to walk and cycle around, like the new Bidadari Park Drive (though to be fair they included a cycle path on one side of it).Will narrower, winding one way roads affect the bus transportation network?

In fact, it also extends to primary/secondary school students, though the very low single trip primary/secondary school fares means most in this age group don't buy passes anyway.# The problemThis pricing system is largely unchanged from the 80s and the 90s where the bus companies were individual operations and SMRT was also a separate thing. Your parents may recall this as the farecard era where one had to pay separate fares every time changing between bus and MRT, and that transfer discounts were only a small discount off the overall fares.This might have worked in the old days, but with the [LTA's introduction of Distance Fares in 2010](https://www.ptc.gov.sg/newsroom/news-releases/newsroom-view/expiry-of-3-fare-rebate-launch-of-distance-fares-on-3-july-2010), we are now at a point where it is possible to ride a bus for free after an MRT ride.The MRT network is also expanding, but we can't build the MRT everywhere nor can we run buses everywhere. The expansion of the MRT will mean that more people will be asked to make trips involving both bus and MRT, a trend that can also be seen in [Census 2020](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/reference/cop2020/cop2020-sr2), where 25.7% of respondents used both bus and rail modes of transport compared to 17.7% in 2010.Under the current concession pass regimes, imposing such a requirement basically asks these groups to double their spending on public transport, because where previously they can buy a much cheaper bus concession, they are now forced to purchase the much more expensive hybrid concession.# Benefits of a passThis is mainly more for university students and NSmen, who pay adult fares otherwise and only gain access to the discounted passes. The situation is similar for senior citizens, but they don't have these single mode prices. Senior citizens get a single pass at $64 ([introduced in 2014 at $60, since increased](https://www.ptc.gov.sg/newsroom/news-releases/newsroom-view/ptc-approves-about-half-of-the-6.6-fare-cap-for-2013-fare-increase-rolls-over-remainder-for-2014-exercise)) that allows them to have unlimited rides on both buses and MRT. Likewise also new in 2014, normal people may apply for the Adult Monthly Travel Pass, that gives unlimited bus and MRT rides at $128 today. Yes, this is a raw deal for a lot of people.For the $128 pass to pay off, it is necessary to spend $4.27 a day on transport, every day, for a month with 30 days. For reference, the highest possible fare payable is $2.26 for journeys above 40.2km, equivalent to travelling from Pasir Ris to Tuas every day (not even Boon Lay or Joo Koon). For a 20 day work month, this increases further to $6.40.On the other hand, a university student who can make the $48 MRT pass work for them (more likely for NUS or SMU kids, less so for NTU) will only have to purchase the pass if they can spend more than $2.40 a day on public transport. It's much easier to reach a $2.40 cap than a $6.40 cap.The most negative effects of this can be seen in NUS, where what I must assume are train concession pass holders all flood the free ISBs, whilst bus 95 sees much less use even when it passes by the same places. [The ISB Man wrote a post](https://theisbman.home.blog/2019/01/17/is-95-free/) exhorting people to take 95, but based on what I'm seeing of 95 it seems to fall on deaf ears, probably because much more people use train concession + free ISBs so can't benefit from the transfer rebates.# What should be done?**One can't help but ask the question on whether the mode-specific concession passes should be removed, and prices of the hybrid concession passes for tertiary students should be dropped down to $64 to align the policy with what is offered for senior citizens.** Other categories of students can also follow suit with just hybrid passes at a new level below $64.By removing incentives for users to stick to a certain mode, we can more efficiently provide public transport especially where our MRT network is expanding with the TEL and other rail lines; the growing MRT network inevitably results in cases where MRT trips used to take a bus, like [the many Bukit Timah expressway routes and maybe even 36 in Marine Parade after TEL4](https://medium.com/from-the-red-line/who-rides-expressway-buses-d6c9522f34a4).

The panel was convened to advise on whether the release of the treated water from Fukushima was safe both for the ocean and for those who depend on it.

I pointed out that since we had to quickly rush to our theory, why not just take a quick smoke break here instead of walking all the way out to the entrance and then back in again. Anyways even the instructors are doing that here. But then when my friend walked over, lit up his cigg, an instructor with his vape, comes over and politely tells him that he can't smoke here and that this place is for instructors only.

Many of us were made aware that from the press release statement announced by CPIB on Tuesday, “Minister S Iswaran is currently assisting the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) with the investigation into a case uncovered by CPIB.”Despite initial promises of transparency by DPM Lawrence Wong, the delayed disclosure and limited details regarding the investigation have left the public questioning the integrity of both the media and the government. On 12 July, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) released a statement acknowledging Minister Iswaran's involvement in an ongoing investigation. However, the lack of specific information regarding the nature of the investigation left the public in the dark. The statement seemed more like a carefully crafted public relations message than an honest account of the situation. It failed to live up to DPM Lawrence Wong's assurance that the government would be upfront and transparent, regardless of potential embarrassment. The subsequent statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on 13 July further exemplifies the lack of transparency in this very serious situation. Instead of providing clarity and full disclosure, PMO merely reiterated the information already known. It was revealed that Minister Iswaran would take a leave of absence and have no access to official resources, but no substantial details about the investigation were provided. This deliberate vagueness raises serious questions about the government's commitment to transparency and accountability.The consequences of sugar-coating the truth could extend far beyond this specific incident. When the media and the government prioritize maintaining a positive image over transparency, public trust erodes quickly.

I am shocked such things happened. So here you go: I can’t say for sure where the Perera-Seah footage came from and who shot it, but I was interested to read about Kenneth Jeyaretnam’s experience of being filmed at Chong Pang while on a Reform Party walkabout, because it rings bells. It’s quite well-known among activists that we are sometimes surreptitiously (and not that surreptitiously) filmed. We can only guess at who these people are and what organisations they work for—of course police and ISD are popular predictions—because they don’t identify themselves to us, but it doesn’t make sense for them to just be random members of the public. Over 10 years ago, I remember going to deliver a clemency petition for Kho Jabing, then turning around to see a couple of guys across the street from the Istana’s side gate filming us. A couple of years ago, when the sister of a death row prisoner went to deliver a letter from families of death row prisoners calling for mercy for Nagaenthran, I saw a couple of men at the Plaza Singapura smoking corner watching her and accompanying friends set off for the Istana. They were hanging out for some time at the smoking corner, but not smoking. Instead, they were holding up phones at an angle that suggested they were filming. Earlier this year, I was outside Changi Prison with a couple of TJC friends waiting for Tangaraju’s family and there was a man dressed in singlet, shorts and slippers standing outside the supermarket across the road from us. He was dressed like a resident running errands, but he wasn’t buying anything from the supermarket or waiting for a Grab. He was just standing there for way longer than it made sense for just some guy going about his day. And his phone was pointing across the street at us. I think I waved at him or did a ✌🏼 pose at some point, and he shifted behind a tiny tree so his face would be obscured from view. He later moved behind a sign/wall (not sure what I should call it) that blocked his face, but at one point I saw him still try to stick his phone out, perhaps to continue filming us or take a photo? Again, I don’t feel safe to jump to the conclusion that the leaked video of Leon and Nicole was an ISD/surveillance job.

t3_1582rwm,What should be done about Singapore’s HDB system?,"We’ve all heard by now CSJ’s famous rants against the ruling party and the HDB Leasehold system. And the recent public and private housing pricing crisis plus the fact that public housing flats are aging is exacerbating the sentiment that perhaps Leasehold is headed towards a ‘doomsday’ scenario when the older flats completely age out. I’ve seen CSJ’s arguments but tbh am very unimpressed. It just seems to rant nonstop and offers no feasible alternatives whatsoever other than to fling around loads of “What if…”.So let’s just get a mini-discussion going here: what should be done otherwise or how should we change the way public housing is handled in Singapore? Keep in mind that land is finite, and in short supply here.Thoughts?My own take on this:1) Artificially deflate and control public housing pricing based off current inflation rates (for eg) and force existing public housing out of the speculation of private market. Based on geographic locations, set price ceilings for public housing. In fact, we already do this for new BTOs by setting the guide price before purchase. We just need to extend this to the resale market.  **Public housing was NEVER supposed to be a speculative asset. End of story.** 2) Related to point 1), Increase MOP for PLH BTOs to 20 years. You like the prime area right? Make sure you willing to stay ultra long-term.3) Introduce more concrete private housing cooling measures to ensure foreigners don’t buy up our residential areas (recent announcement might count but more can be done).4) Buyout close to aged out HDB plots at discounted or equal to fair market value to build new BTO plots.

As a land-scarce city, we should aspire for true car-lite urban infrastructure. That does not mean physically limiting the number of cars on the roads, but designing infrastructure and policies in such a way that people don't want to drive.For a lot of trips in Singapore, driving is still faster and more convenient than public transit. Excluding the initial capital outlay of purchasing a car, it's also not much more expensive, as Singapore has very cheap parking by international standards. This leads to 2 problems: 1) people who can afford cars want to buy cars, 2) people who already own cars want to drive cars.We need to design urban infrastructure to not accommodate and prioritize cars as much. That means dedicated cycling lanes, more bus lanes in residential areas, and more road diets for cars. We have excellent public transit, but we arguably have even better car infrastructure. Public transit should not be something you take because you can't afford a car, it should be something you want to take because it is overall a better experience.I don't know if this is possible, but I think it is something we should strive towards. The top cities in the world where people commute by non-car modes don't have COEs. So clearly, it is possible to design cities in a way where people don't want to drive. Anecdotally, I have coworkers in NYC who do own cars (because they moved from car-dependent suburbs) but rarely drive, because driving is simply a worse experience than taking public transit.Personally, I enjoy taking public transit in Singapore a lot - I don't have to think about traffic, it frees up time for me to read, it's inexpensive, it's clean, and there are no crazies around unlike in some other cities. My only gripe is that buses are slow and regularly stuck in traffic, and I wish I could be zipping through bus lanes and bypassing all the cars on the roads.

Anecdotally, I have coworkers in NYC who do own cars (because they moved from car-dependent suburbs) but rarely drive, because driving is simply a worse experience than taking public transit.Personally, I enjoy taking public transit in Singapore a lot - I don't have to think about traffic, it frees up time for me to read, it's inexpensive, it's clean, and there are no crazies around unlike in some other cities. My only gripe is that buses are slow and regularly stuck in traffic, and I wish I could be zipping through bus lanes and bypassing all the cars on the roads. ",0.9829,positive

Link: bit dot ly slash appealtoNAFAImage: https://i.imgur.com/TAJcCh1.jpgTLDR: A strong turpentine smell came from my table on Thursday, 24 August 2023. Turpentine was poured on my belongings, artworks and materials. I am currently still recovering from symptoms such as rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my nose and eyes. This is my appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again for a thorough investigation, and for disciplinary actions to be taken towards those who were responsible for the act.Thanks for reading the following post. I am one who believes in spreading positivity on social media posts. Unfortunately, this is my final resort as I believe that more can be done to assist in the turpentine incident that I had raised. And I would like to hereby appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again and take disciplinary action towards those who were responsible for pouring turpentine onto my table, belongings, artworks and art materials on Thursday, 24 August 2023. On 24 August at 9.30am, I left some of my belongings, artworks and art materials on my studio desk. The studio is located at NAFA’s tower block. At 5.30pm, I came back to the studio and noticed a strong smell of turpentine coming from my table. The smell was also coming from my belongings, artworks and art materials. I went to the toilet immediately to get a tissue paper, soaked with soap and water and cleaned the table. My hands started to experience fiery sensations and I quickly packed my things. About half an hour after that, I experienced breathing issues and dizziness. My eyes and nose have also since experienced fiery sensations. Since the episode, I have repeatedly consulted doctors with regards to my symptoms and have not been able to attend school or complete my art assignments at all. In addition, I am not able to use any of my art materials since they have already been contaminated with turpentine. Currently, I am still recuperating from the symptoms of rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my eyes and nose. The incident had not only affected my physical health, but my mental health. I have been feeling angry, sad, anxious and confused all at the same time. What saddened me the most was that I had also shared some of my pre-existing medical conditions to the class, and yet, with the information provided, someone or a group of individuals had harmed my physical harm through the use of a hazardous chemical. I would like to highlight the following: 1. People who have pre-existing medical conditions deserve the right to study and work in a safe environment.2. Persons who have pre-existing medical conditions share their struggles in living with various conditions, not to be harmed.3. No one (regardless of whether they have or do not have pre-existing conditions) should never have their physical body harmed in any way.My heart just feels heavy at this moment and I’m crying while typing this. I would never wish for anyone to go through what I had gone through. And if anyone had gone through the same, I feel you and you are not alone. And please do the necessary by speaking up about what had happened and seek medical and professional help, if necessary. A school should be a safe place for students, whether physically or psychologically. However, in this situation, my physical health has been compromised. I hope NAFA will take actionable steps to investigate the situation, take disciplinary actions towards those who were responsible and their accomplices for the act.",Public Safety,-0.8,0.9,0.7,-0.9377,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/16j7xyd/harassment_using_turpentine_at_nafa/,Reddit,2023-09-15 08:52:00,"Harassment using Turpentine at NAFA Sharing this story on behalf of my wife.

I am currently still recovering from symptoms such as rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my nose and eyes. This is my appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again for a thorough investigation, and for disciplinary actions to be taken towards those who were responsible for the act.Thanks for reading the following post. I am one who believes in spreading positivity on social media posts. Unfortunately, this is my final resort as I believe that more can be done to assist in the turpentine incident that I had raised. And I would like to hereby appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again and take disciplinary action towards those who were responsible for pouring turpentine onto my table, belongings, artworks and art materials on Thursday, 24 August 2023. On 24 August at 9.30am, I left some of my belongings, artworks and art materials on my studio desk. The studio is located at NAFA’s tower block. At 5.30pm, I came back to the studio and noticed a strong smell of turpentine coming from my table. The smell was also coming from my belongings, artworks and art materials. I went to the toilet immediately to get a tissue paper, soaked with soap and water and cleaned the table. My hands started to experience fiery sensations and I quickly packed my things. About half an hour after that, I experienced breathing issues and dizziness. My eyes and nose have also since experienced fiery sensations. Since the episode, I have repeatedly consulted doctors with regards to my symptoms and have not been able to attend school or complete my art assignments at all. In addition, I am not able to use any of my art materials since they have already been contaminated with turpentine. Currently, I am still recuperating from the symptoms of rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my eyes and nose. The incident had not only affected my physical health, but my mental health. I have been feeling angry, sad, anxious and confused all at the same time. What saddened me the most was that I had also shared some of my pre-existing medical conditions to the class, and yet, with the information provided, someone or a group of individuals had harmed my physical harm through the use of a hazardous chemical. I would like to highlight the following: 1. People who have pre-existing medical conditions deserve the right to study and work in a safe environment.2. Persons who have pre-existing medical conditions share their struggles in living with various conditions, not to be harmed.3. No one (regardless of whether they have or do not have pre-existing conditions) should never have their physical body harmed in any way.My heart just feels heavy at this moment and I’m crying while typing this. I would never wish for anyone to go through what I had gone through. And if anyone had gone through the same, I feel you and you are not alone. And please do the necessary by speaking up about what had happened and seek medical and professional help, if necessary. A school should be a safe place for students, whether physically or psychologically. However, in this situation, my physical health has been compromised. I hope NAFA will take actionable steps to investigate the situation, take disciplinary actions towards those who were responsible and their accomplices for the act.",-0.8817,negative

In a statement on Wednesday, the SFA said that it detected *Staphylococcus aureus*  (S. aureus) in Joymom’s Musang King Snowskin Mooncake. The agency also  found aflatoxins, a type of toxin produced by fungus, in Fragrance’s  Single Yolk Lotus Paste Baked Mooncake. Both substances were present at levels exceeding the maximum limits stated in Singapore’s food regulations, said the SFA. The importers of the products, Taste Right and Fragrance Foodstuff,  were directed by the agency on Wednesday to recall the mooncakes. The  recall process is currently ongoing.S. aureus is commonly found in the environment, and on human skin or  in noses, and can cause food poisoning when it is introduced into food  during the production process, particularly when good hand hygiene is  not practised, said SFA.Symptoms can include sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhoea.Aflatoxins, on the other hand, can contaminate food as a result of  fungal contamination, and are known to be genotoxic and carcinogenic,  meaning they can damage DNA and cause cancer, the agency added.   Foods that can be contaminated include cereals, nuts, oilseeds and  processed foods containing these ingredients. It is crucial to keep  exposure to aflatoxins as low as possible.The expiry date of Joymom’s Musang King Snowskin Mooncake is March 5,  2024, and the Fragrance’s Single Yolk Lotus Paste Baked Mooncake  expires on Oct 20, 2023. Both products were imported from Malaysia.Consumers who purchased the affected mooncakes are advised not to  consume them, said SFA.

t3_17nl80h,any other singles in their late twenties just kinda… rotting away?,"  I’ve been struggling for the past year since breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years. The reason (among a few others like arguing and her general mood swings being a bit too much for me to bear) was because she wanted to further her studies overseas at the time and we were on different paths. I didn’t want to hold her back so I chose to end things then. I used to have flings in uni, but she was my first proper relationship and it was hard for me to initiate the breakup as a result. But at the time I chose to do what was best. Since then I tried going on a few dates here and there but honestly no one comes close to her in terms of looks, chemistry and compatibility and it’s extremely frustrating. I just want to be loved and love in turn. i have an decent paying but high pressure job and not much of a social life. I’m a creature of habit, so the weeks tend to blend by. I go to the gym, I work, I play video games, I hang out maybe once or twice every two weeks for social purposes. You could pluck any week of the year so far and half of the time i couldn't tell you if i had that week in one month or the other. I already tried therapy but I feel after a while I get diminishing rewards from it. I’ve always had depression but in the past year I’ve really felt like no matter what I do, I just can’t seem to find happiness in life. Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve wasted my youth and I don’t have much hope for things to get better – in fact it feels like things inevitably only will get worse as you get older with more responsibilities and more loss (inevitable passing of parents etc). I don’t really feel much excitement to be alive or anything at all.

t3_1929jah,Why I feel that SimplyGo is very inconvenient and Nets Flashpay should not be discontinued,"With the announcement of the discontinuation of Nets Flashpay for paying bus and MRT rides, I want to voice out as to why I find simplygo a hassle. Source: LTASG’s instagram post dated 9/1/2024, as at the time of posting, it was announced about 2-3hrs ago.The advantage of simplygo is that it allows mobile topup and checking of balance, however, I find way too many issues with the system which is why I switched to nets flashpay.For context, I switched to simplygo because the staff said I could get $2 rebate. Then, I had to keep using app to check. One fine day, the entire simplygo system went down - I can’t check balance on app AND I couldn’t even topup my card at the topup machine. I ended up using nets flashpay and when I learnt nets flashpay is going to be no longer allowed, I’m very disappointed.First issue with Nets flashpay is that you need mobile data to check balance, if for any reason the network is down, you need to go to ticket machine to check. This can be a problem if you don’t auto-topup like me. Thankfully I live near MRT. However, I need to keep checking and looking at app just to ensure I have enough if I want to ride bus so that I don’t realise I have not enough and need go MRT station topup/pay cash.Second problem is this - how would I know if I got properly tap in/out (applies to bank card as well)? If I walk to the gantry and the person infront use simplygo, and then I tap and gate remains open, I can only assume I tapped in. Unlike nets flashpay, if I tap in/out, I confirm will know that I successfully tap card unless the person infront hv the exact same balance and pay the exact same fare as me. I like the 2000s era ezlink card system which is still being used in nets flashpay cards, I know how much I left after a ride and I can just go and topup instead of guessing how much I have in my card and I’m basically left being reliant on a system that if it is down or network is down, it is back to the 2000s where I need to go to the machine to check. Given that based on ltasg’s instagram post stating that “simplygo transactions are processed backend”, my suggestion is to just reconsider and not discontinue nets flashpay “because two in three adult fares are made with simplygo or bank cards” for the convenience of users who still want to see their balance. Moreover, if a system outrage happens on the simplygo system AFTER the discontinuation of nets flashpay, how am I supposed to pay for my ride if I can’t topup? Pay cash fares or use bank card? In this case I might as well use bank card instead of simplygo?I completely do not agree that nets flashpay should be discontinued just because at least 67% switched payments. In the end, this should still be left as an option just like how one ticket machine still accepts cash topups (although honestly, why can’t it be improved so that ALL of the machine accept cash but that’s a discussion for another day).",Transport,-0.8,0.9,0.9,0.8433,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1929jah/why_i_feel_that_simplygo_is_very_inconvenient_and/,Reddit,2024-01-09 07:55:00,"Why I feel that SimplyGo is very inconvenient and Nets Flashpay should not be discontinued With the announcement of the discontinuation of Nets Flashpay for paying bus and MRT rides, I want to voice out as to why I find simplygo a hassle.

t3_1b3nc03,A creep nudged his shoulder against mine on the train and I didn’t fight back,"This happened to me few weeks ago but I’m still angry about it.I (33F) was on the train one evening (about 9pm) on the way home. The train wasn’t super crowded but the seats were occupied so I was standing. At one of the stops, I saw someone vacate her seat and alighted the train. I waited for a while to see if anyone took the seat but nobody did so I walked over and sat in it. I was leaning forward (elbows on my knees) and engrossed on my phone. About 1 stop later I looked up and noticed this uncle (probably about 60?) staring at my face. Like he literally stuck his neck out and his face was kinda invading my personal space. I have some facial piercings so I’m used to being stared at because of them (especially kids who don’t know any better), so I ignored him thinking he was probably staring at my piercings.Then he told me “you’re very cute”. I gave him a slight nod but didn’t smile back. I went back to my phone. He asked me “are you Singaporean?” (I could feel his face still near mine). I pretended not to hear him and continued to look at my phone, but internally I kinda froze up and didn’t know how to react. He then raised his voice a bit and asked once more ARE YOU SINGAPOREAN while nudging his shoulder against mine. Without a word I immediately stood up and walked away to another carriage. I felt so disgusted that I felt like scrubbing my shoulder with bleach. Thinking back I’m still angry about it. Not at him, but at myself for not doing more about it. I should have said something, yelled at him, or could have even taken a photo/video of him. But instead all I did was walk away. I’m so mad at myself!!! Thinking back, I wonder if that’s the reason why nobody wanted to take the vacant seat? Maybe they had already noticed something amiss but I didn’t notice cos I was standing quite a distance away from the seat. A similar incident happened to me when I was 18 (a man put his hand on my thigh). It was the first time something like that happened to me and back then, I didn’t even move away. I let him rest his hand there for the entire 20 min ride. Ever since that incident, I told myself I would never let anything like that happen ever again and I would fight back.Whenever I read about similar stories, I would tell myself “if it ever happens to me, I MUST remember to fight back”.

t3_1brho0v,Issue with SG Healthcare: Doctor working hours and why it affects you,"I’m a doctor working in Singapore. I think we’ve reached a point where most Singaporeans understand the main issues with our healthcare system. The system is tough on everyone including the nurses and allied health professionals.Junior doctors have many woes including renumeration, dealing with bureacracy, healthcare worker abuse. For this post, I would like to focus solely on the **most absurd** aspect of our current healthcare system: the working hours for doctors.Personally, this is most ridiculous existing issue and requires urgent, if not immediate change. The current system is outdated and disregards patient safety.It is easy for the general public to dismiss this issue and say things like “doctors knew what they were signing up for” etc, but this problem affects every Singaporean. Anyone could end up seeking treatment in a public hospital. Imagine if your loved one was being operated on by a doctor who has not slept in 24 hours. This possibly occurs on a daily basis. **Current Working Hours:**The average junior doctor reaches the hospital around 6-6.30am. This varies according to patient load in the hospital department, some doctors reach earlier at 5am or earlier based on manpower needs.The main reason for this early reporting time  varies depending on speciality and should be kept for a separate post. The main focus of this post is the call system.**Call System (Night Duty)**Overnight doctor duties in public hospitals are covered by the “call” system. This system is outdated and the main cause of the problem. Nurses operate on a shift system where continuous working hours are capped to the shift. A&E doctors also use shift systems. Some hospitals have progressed to a “night float” system which also caps continuous working hours. **However most hospitals still operate using the “call system” for doctors.**What exactly is a call system?Simply put, when doctors are “on call”, they are scheduled to cover the night shift for that day. The catch is that they work the whole day, cover the night shift, then proceed to work the next day as well.When doctors leave work after a call, it’s called going “post-call”. The official postcall timing is about 12pm, but this is subject to patient load. It is not unusual to leave at 2-3pm if needed, with the not-so-occasional horror stories of doctors going postcall at 6pm. Eg if a doctor is scheduled for “call” on 1st April; they will arrive at work about 6-6.30am on 1st April, work the whole day and night, then proceed to work the next morning as well. Ideally they will leave by 12pm on 2nd April and will have some rest before reporting to work as usual at 6am on 3rd April. An official “postcall timing” of 12pm makes each call a 30 hour shift. This means that every morning, you have doctors in SG with little to no sleep reviewing patients, ordering blood test and scans, precribing meds. Isn’t this crazy?Some hospital departments have tried to fix this problem by implementing an “8am postcall” system. This would mean that doctors would be able to leave the hospital at 8am after their call ends, bringing the average worktime per call to a ~26 hour shift. This prevents doctors from working the morning after the call which reduces the risk of sleep-deprived making medical errors.**What needs to be done?**Mandatory 8 am post-call timings should be a MOH priority. 26 hour shifts still sound ridiculous but it is still a first step in the right direction. Doctors should not be allowed to work continuously for >24 hours given the possibly harm to patients. **TLDR:** In Singapore, you have doctors on 30 hour shifts examining, prescribing meds and even performing surgery on your loved ones.",Healthcare,-0.8,0.9,0.9,-0.9533,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1brho0v/issue_with_sg_healthcare_doctor_working_hours_and/,Reddit,2024-03-30 13:17:00,"Issue with SG Healthcare: Doctor working hours and why it affects you I’m a doctor working in Singapore.

t3_1brm66o,Stranger taking photos of children,"So apparently, today, an old uncle (in his 50s - 60s from China) is taking photos of all the children in a play area designed for kids at a shopping mall. We can tell as we saw from his phone that he was bust taking photos. Pointing his phone in the kids face. The kids are all between (2\~5 years old). At first, we find it weird and to understand the situation, we asked him if he is grandfather of one of the kids, however, he reveal that he does not have a grandkid and the children in the play area are not related to him.

t3_1cax9w3,I genuinely hope the tragic Tampines crash will force a safer redesign of Singapore roads,"After reading about it, and seeing the dash cam footage, I had trouble falling asleep last night. The footage was raw and traumatic and to know that within that few frames, 2 people have died, was very disturbing. It was such fucking senseless violence, and because of the egos and recklessness of a couple of assholes, innocent lives are lost. I’m not going to call it an accident. Traffic safety advocates discourage the phrase “traffic accident”. You can read about it [here](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/8995151/crash-not-accident), but the TLDR is that these crashes are not inevitable, they are preventable with safer road design. Just a few months ago, [a 4 year old girl was killed in River Valley along a road where drivers commonly speed](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/river-valley-institution-hill-car-accident-four-year-old-girl-died-4084356). And there is no shortage of many more crashes with cyclists, pedestrians, other road users, skids, etc.It is no surprise to anyone that speeding kills. And our laws against driving infractions are way too lax, yes. But that’s a separate topic for another discussion, however valid and warranted it may be.The probability of serious injury and death increases exponentially with vehicular speed. A car driving at double the speed has 4x the amount of kinetic energy. Speeding increases both the frequency and severity of crashes. As much as punishment feels right and just, we need to redesign our roads to prevent speeding in the first place. It is well established that the majority of drivers don’t drive at the posted speed limit, they drive at a speed that feels comfortable given the driving conditions of the environment. And a lot of Singapore’s roads are designed to be straight and wide to optimize for vehicular flow.  The old thinking was that you can reduce crashes by making driving “easier” - but studies after studies have shown this is not the case, because the safer it feels, the faster drivers drive, and the deadlier the outcomes. So road design that tells you to go fast, coupled with spotty enforcement, is just going to result in lots of speeding.In Netherlands, they pioneered a new road design known as [“naked streets”](https://streetswithoutcars.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/naked-streets/) where all hard safety measures are removed in residential streets. It reduced congestion, decreased crashes, and had the side benefit of increased traffic flow. That concept has been successfully applied around the world too.I’m not suggesting replacing every street with that. Clearly there are other considerations at play, and other road designs. I’m not a traffic engineer or urban planner. But the status quo of wide roads, fast cars, and preventable crashes is clearly untenable. LTA needs to seriously reevaluate current road design and adopt best practices from globally leading cities in this area. I read/watched somewhere that our straight wide road designs were a page out of the US’s road design playbook - if this is true, it’s a nasty path to tread down, because US cities are some of the worst in road safety among developed nations.Credit where it is due - the Silver Zone neighborhoods that LTA is pioneering are pretty pleasant. But that should be the default, not only in specially designated areas. Even the so called car-lite Tengah is terribly car-centric.Honestly, I don’t know what we can do as individuals.

t3_1cvmmgv,Singapore condo pricing is becoming more determined by market sentiment than actual buyer needs.,"From my personal observations, I have noticed that in recent years, the price of condos has become based less on what condo buyers actually want or need and more on what everyone thinks other buyers want which tbh to me feels completely off kilter. To elaborate, I noticed lately there are certain things that many people look out for in condos that will give it unreasonable premiums. Things such as proximity to good schools, having certain facilities like tennis courts, etc. For one, the number of school children has been dropping each year, I just find it difficult to understand why the premium for housing near good schools (sorry all schools are good schools okay?) is increasing so much each passing year. And then facilities like tennis court -- are they really so important as to push up the price so much compared to one nearby without? Almost no one I talk to living in condo really care about it or even utilise it but they say they look out for some of these factors because it makes it easier to sell at higher price in the future. Also some things like larger but fewer bedrooms are cast aside in favour of more but much smaller bedrooms. Even developers are taking cue and building more and more of such tiny bedroom condos cramming as many bedrooms as they can into 800 sq ft spaces. Who the heck chooses to live like that and why do they command a premium? Each room feels like a capsule in a capsule hotel.Which brings me to the next point. People nowadays keep talking about buying housing with an ""exit strategy"" macam it's an investment. Maybe there's nothing wrong with treating it as some kind of investment but it seems nowadays, a condo's intrinsic value as a shelter is lower than it's value as a speculation vehicle where everyone seem to have agreed that a condo needs to have x,y,z in order for it to have ""good"" value even though they don't really want x,y,z themselves personally.

NTUC Income policyholders will soon be robbed by Allianz who can legally rob them under the T&Cs of their policies.An insurance company, at the end of the day, is a large pool of assets that are invested, most of which are eventually paid out in claims or benefits to policyholders. The market value of an insurance company is necessarily far smaller than the value of this pool of assets. Income Insurance is no different, and it holds billions in dollars of assets which effectively belong to their Singaporean policyholders. There are plenty of completely legal tricks Allianz can do to pocket this money without violating Income’s covenants with policyholders. For instance, many life insurance or endowment policies have a non-guaranteed benefit component upon maturity or death - and Income has likely accrued upwards of 8 billion in non-guaranteed benefit liabilities alone. All it takes for the rug to be pulled from these policyholders’ feet, is for Allianz to “invest” these monies “in good faith” \*wink wink nod nod\* in a way that benefits a Allianz-related counterparty. Income policyholders become an ATM for Allianz to book a near-immediate massive profit. This way, Allianz’s purchase of Income Insurance for 2.2 billion more than pays for itself. This arrangement reeks of unjust enrichment, and even if it goes through, there should be a microscopic level of regulatory monitoring to ensure that Allianz does not try to pull some shenanigans to legally fleece Income policyholders. Singapore’s regulatory framework regarding the corporate governance of insurance companies can be considered woefully inadequate. In a normal country, policyholders would be considered key stakeholders in an insurance company, and would have been able to veto the corporatization of NTUC Income, and the subsequent acquisition by Allianz. Ordinary Singaporeans purchased NTUC Income policies because they believed the government's message that NTUC Income had a social mission; to allow Allianz to fleece them now is a bait-and-switch of the most despicable nature, and 100% on the government if MAS allows this repugnant transaction to go through.

t3_1ervovr,Do something for your country this month: voice your objection to the sale of Income Insurance to Allianz,"This month (August 2024), do something for your country and for your family.   Write to your MP (and cc PM & DPM) to voice your unhappiness re the sale of Income Insurance to German insurer Allianz.Don’t know the email address of your MP?  Fret not, see below for a list of email addresses of all PAP MPs (and some PAP MP-wanna-be).  Apologies that I am not able to provide personal email addresses of all MPs, but if anyone has, please share (esp that of Ms Ng Ling Ling and Cheryl Chan Wei Ling).  [Note:  email addresses collated from publicly-available sources].  Apologies for the poor formatting … if anyone can improve the formatting, it will be much appreciated.Suggestions (to avoid any MPs inadvertently missing your email):(1) If more than one email address is given, suggest to include all email addresses in your email(2) If you live in a GRC, then write to all the email addresses of all the MPs in your GRC(3) Always cc the PM and DPM in all your emails to your MPs(4) Alternatively, you can address your email to your MP (including the other MPs in your GRC, if you’re in a GRC), and then cc the rest of the 70-80+ MPs in your email, so that at least some of them get to read your email.Feel free to draft your own email, or to use the following sample email (amend and improve as appropriate):Dear MP (or MP-wanna-be),I write to voice my unhappiness over the sale of Income Insurance to Allianz.  There are just so many things to object about this deal, including the following: (1) unfair treatment of minority shareholders vis-à-vis NTUC Enterprise, (2) breach of good faith by NTUC Enterprise re their statement to remain majority shareholder of Income post-corporatisation, (3) Income Insurance becoming a profit-maximisation commercial company, vs operating as a non-profit maximisation entity with social mission, which will impact on many of Income’s 1.7m existing policyholders,  (4) conflict or possible conflict of interest involved re Income appointing Morgan Stanley as their financial advisor etc, which was brushed over by MAS’s Mr Chee Hong Tat in Parliament recently etcI wish to also object to Income’s management, ex-Ministers and current Ministers spouting many absurd, illogical and redundant statements to gloss over the public’s objections to the sale.  Aside from making themselves look foolish, we, the constituents do NOT like your colleagues continuing to (i) talk us down, assuming that we are stupid and (ii) insult our intelligence.  Please stop trying to gloss over real facts and please stop assuming all your constituents are sheeple.    You would also do well to remind your colleagues (through the PM and DPM) that nonsensical comments by your ministers would be permanently imprinted on the internet, widely circulated in social media and the international press too.  Stop being the laughing stock the world over.There are many hundreds of thousands of other Singapore citizens who are not happy with the Income sale, but they are not writing to you, for various reasons. I am taking the time to write to you because I am concerned about the way this country is heading, including the sale of Income, which looks like the establishment is pushing down the throats of the stakeholders.   Stop the sale.Your response, or non-response, to my above views and my request, will determine how I vote in the coming General Elections.  Even if you are not standing in the next GE, it is your responsibility to share my email, and my views, with your successor(s), and with the PM and DPM.Awaiting a response from you on this matter (which can include your comments to the local press or on social media, but please publicise widely your views, or non-views).Regards,Your constituent, and voter in the next GE[Note: Feel free to copy-and-paste or share this post with everyone you know, including on social media]AMK GRC1Lee Hsien Loonglee_hsien_loong@pmo.gov.sg2Gan Thiam Pohgan.thiam.poh@amktc.org.sg3Darryl DavidDarryl.David@pap.org.sg;

Unfortunately, there does not seem be clear information or formulas on how the penalties are determined for previous disruptions.

Analysts estimate that NSL and EWL account for $500mil and SMRT could have been fined up to $50m. SMRT's FY23/24 revenue is $886.7m. There is no information on the breakdown of SMRT's revenue by its 4 major lines, but presumably EWL takes up the largest share and would be closer to 30-40% ($266m-$355m).

A fine of $15.4m for a disruption that affects 1 million commuters and disrupting their journeys for perhaps an average of 1hr would put the value of that 1hr at $15. Is that a fair value?

t3_1g7yv3h,Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System,"In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones. This approach is creating significant issues, particularly when people have their eyes on a specific project but are forced to consider other projects within the same estate. For example, the recent BTO launch includes 3 bundled Bedok projects (2 Bayshore sites and 1 Kembangan site) and 3 bundled Kallang/Whampoa sites (1 Lavender site, 1 Whampoa site, 1 Upper Boon Keng site). Applicants do not have the option to ballot for a single site; they must enter the ballot for all sites in the same bundle.# 1. ""Forced to Choose"" to avoid New Penalty RulesOne of the primary issues is that applicants aiming for a specific project are automatically entered into a ballot for every project in the estate. If they fail to get a favorable queue number for their desired project, they may be forced to choose from other projects that they may have no real interest in. Otherwise, they’ll have to face a one-year wait-out penalty where they are barred from balloting again.This creates an undesirable situation where applicants must either settle for a less appealing project just to avoid the penalty, or be locked out of the system for a year. It’s not just about getting lucky — in the current state, even ""average luck"" won’t suffice if applicants are aiming for highly sought-after projects. Let's look at the current BTO exercise as an example: those who are interested in Crawford Heights (prime location with only 234 4R units) are currently competing with 1,880 other applicants, meaning only about the top 15% will secure a unit at Crawford Heights, while the rest must choose between the other two projects (Towner Breeze and Kallang View) or face the one-year penalty. Now this used to be less of an issue in previous exercises where projects were bundled together as an estate. For example October 2023's Kallang/Whampoa BTO launch also had 3 different sites bundled together, and while one is a PLH, the other two are standard flats with 5 year MOP. If applicants were not able to select their desired PLH flat, they could still choose either of the standard flats and only serve a 5-year MOP. This provided applicants with a valuable safety net: if they could not secure their preferred PLH flat, they still had the option to select one of the standard flats and only commit to a 5-year MOP, allowing for greater flexibility in their housing decisions. Not to mention, these standard flats came with no restrictions, were still situated in prime areas, and held significant potential profit after just 5 years. Unfortunately, all Kallang/Whampoa projects in the current exercise are at least Plus flats, and have a 10 year MOP. This means that applicants could potentially be locked into a longer commitment in a home they might not genuinely want. Whether due to job relocations, changes in family size, or shifts in personal preferences, being tied to a property for such an extended period can severely limit options.**2. Pitfalls of Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)**The MCPS is designed to encourage applicants to live near their parents by granting them an extra ballot chance for projects located close to their parents' homes. However, in large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, the geographic spread of available projects can be quite vast. This creates a situation where people aiming for a specific project near their parents may find themselves instead needing to consider another project that is far from them.Moreover, applicants can apply for this scheme as long as at least one of the units bundled together is near their parents, thereby birthing a potential loophole in this scheme whereby applicants can use their proximity advantage to gain a better chance for a project that is not actually near their parents. For instance, someone who qualifies for the scheme because their parents live near Project A could use that extra ballot chance to select a unit in Project B, even if Project B is far from their parents (assuming both Project A and B are lumped into the same estate). This undermines the original purpose of the scheme, which is meant to facilitate closer family living, not provide an unfair advantage for unrelated projects.**3. Neglecting Locational Differences and Individual Needs**    Lumping multiple projects into a single estate-wide ballot fails to account for both the geographical spread and applicants' individual preferences. In large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, projects can be located far apart, making it unfair to treat them as one choice. Applicants aiming for a specific location may end up balloting for projects that are not as conveniently located. This approach also disregards varied personal priorities—whether it's proximity to work, family, or access to amenities—reducing the process to simply securing a unit, rather than finding a home that meets their specific needs.  In light of these issues, one must wonder why HDB continue to implement this bundled ballot system. While the intention may be to streamline the application process and increase efficiency, it raises serious concerns about fairness and the ability of Singaporeans to secure homes that genuinely meet their needs. As the housing landscape evolves, it is essential for HDB to consider these implications and adapt its approach to better serve the diverse needs of its BTO applicants.",Housing,-0.7,0.9,0.9,0.9958,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7yv3h/exposing_a_huge_flaw_in_the_current_bto_balloting/,Reddit,2024-10-20 13:36:00,"Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones.

My starting pay was $1.6k (havent include employer cpf and 1 month bonus that he give every year) a month. I slowly increased my pay throughout the years and now I am going 36yo next year, my dad will increase my pay to $4.5k for next year.I feel that I am underpaid. What would diploma holders my age be earning on average can anyone give me a range? Although pay feels low some perks is that we use family car to work so I dont need to spend on transportation and usually I eat with them so save alot on food too. Im also single so dont need to spend much. Work usually nothing much although occassionly there are busy periods but overall I would say is lax and pretty easy.What would you do in my situation? Im also not sure when my father will retire. Singapore is an expensive country and he seems to want to work as long as possible. Pay seems to be getting more and more stagnant like the $4.5k he wasnt too happy (Initially he said $4.45k increase from $4.3k but I said it was low so he add $50). But I forsee pay getting harder to increase. I ever saw his iras income statement once years ago and is $100k annual (Mine would be $67275 nxt year for comparison). But he claims now he is earning lower. I see my friend also work for dad in mid 20s dad passed biz fully to him alrdy.

t3_1ha7t3h,"Identity thieves cancel S’pore man’s credit cards, leaving him and wife strapped for cash in Japan","SINGAPORE - Singaporean Melvin Chan’s recent holiday to Japan with his wife turned into a nightmare after he found their bank accounts blocked and credit cards cancelled by identity thieves who rang up the banks and pretended to be them.Mr Chan, 35, was at the Tokyo DisneySea theme park on Oct 7 when he and his wife realised that none of their cards were working.“DisneySea is a cashless attraction. Almost everything there requires you to pay with card - from restaurants to the express passes for the rides. I think maybe only the souvenir shops accepted cash payment,” said Mr Chan.He and his wife spent three hours calling DBS, UOB and OCBC from the theme park - racking up $200 in roaming charges in the process - and would later find out that their cards had been cancelled by someone else who called the banks.This person, who posed as Mr Chan, asked the banks to do so on the pretext that he had lost his belongings.“We were shocked to find that all my credit cards were cancelled and our bank accounts were blocked. The bank officers told us that we would need to be back in Singapore to reinstate them,” said Mr Chan, who has reported the matter to the police.“My wife is Thai... so we transferred money from her bank account in Thailand to my YouTrip travel card.

But this incident comes as banks are facing increasing pressure to safeguard customer funds from scams and fraud.Figures from the police show that scam victims in Singapore lost $385.6m in the first six months of 2024, with a record 26,587 cases logged during that period.UOB and OCBC told The Straits Times that safeguarding the funds in their customers’ accounts is their top priority and that card blocking and cancellation were important anti-fraud measures.The two banks cancelled his cards after receiving calls from someone who claimed to be him, said Mr Chan. The caller had apparently passed identity verification requests after a few failed attempts.Mr Chan said he is upset with the banks for not attempting to contact him when the caller initially failed the verification questions.When asked about what happened, a UOB spokesman said the bank prioritises the “swift securing of the customer’s account” against any unauthorised access.“Callers are required to provide personal details of the cardholders such as their NRIC number, card and account details. This approach is in line with industry standards,” he said.MORE ON THIS TOPICTravel Journal: I lost €200 in Paris and fought with scammers to claw some of it backAI scams targeting those travelling to Malaysia on the riseAcknowledging Mr Chan’s inconvenience, an OCBC spokesman said the bank will continue to enhance its processes “to strike the right balance between security and convenience for our customers”, and expressed readiness to assist in police investigations.As for DBS, the bank said it received a similar request to block Mr Chan’s cards and “immediately acted to prioritise his account and card security by following our protocol for card blocking”.For DBS, callers only need to provide an account holder’s full name, and phone or NRIC number for cards to be blocked.Mr Chan said he urged the bank to introduce stronger safeguards, such as requiring a one-time password (OTP) before blocking accounts.DBS confirmed that its customer service team had assisted Mr Chan by implementing an additional security alert on his profile, and ensuring all further instructions concerning his account and cards were only undertaken via calls verified with an additional SMS OTP.Mr Chan said his wife faced an issue accessing her DBS savings account online.“When my wife tried to log into DBS ibanking from Tokyo, there was a message telling her to (contact) the call centre for assistance. Until today, I have not heard from the bank how this could have happened,” said Mr Chan.“My wife and I are victims of an impersonation attack and the caller’s intention was to block our access to our finances and disrupt our holiday.”MORE ON THIS TOPICHackers pose as bank customers by stealing OTPs, making $500k in fake credit card paymentsMore charges handed to scam syndicate members allegedly involved in credit card fraudThe ordeal has taught Mr Chan that the banks’ thresholds for identity verification can be quite low, which he points out creates potential loopholes. Some banks even allow a third-party, such as a family member, to make cancellations.“As long as someone has your full name and phone number, the person can call the bank to block your credit card,” he said.He added that the banks have so far declined to give him details on what verification questions were posed to the impersonator, meaning he has been unable to take any immediate steps to safeguard his data.As for who has been impersonating him, Mr Chan suspects the caller is someone his wife knows from work.The person had apparently also called up the gym frequented by the couple trying to transfer their memberships to another branch.“We were able to trace the caller’s number through the gym and found it was linked to this person my wife knows from work,” said Mr Chan.Lawyer Sunil Sudheesan, head of the criminal law department of Quahe Woo & Palmer, warned that the low-thresholds for verification - where banks accept requests with minimal details such as a full name and NRIC number and third party cancellations - could create an opportunity for irritants to exploit.“The threshold as it stands is necessarily low given the spectrum of consumers out there. However, some level of verification with cardholders would be ideal,” said Mr Sudheesan.“I support a callback verification mechanism, but freeze accounts in the meantime as opposed to immediately cancelling them at face value when a third party calls.”He added that impersonation could constitute an offence under the Penal Code, if a person is found to be cheating by pretending to be another person.

Given the last three digits + year of birth, I'm already able to figure out the 5 out of 7 of the NRIC numberThe next 5 numbers are given sequentially. This means that if I'm able to figure out how many babies were born before me on year 199X, I can deduce the next 5 numbers. Given that I already know the ladt 3 digits, I only need to know the thousandth and the ten thousandth number. Singstat very helpfully provided me the number of babies born each month here: https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M810051. If I add the total number of babies in months born before me (eg Jan 90 babies + Feb 90 babies + ... + X 90 babies), I can get very close to the number I was born. If I want to be more precise, I can also use the day I was born, divide it by the days of the month, and do an extrapolation to estimate the thousandth and the ten thousandth number.This so far is an estimation. However, the government has also provided tools to verify my guess. First, I could use the last letter of the alphabet, to ensure that the checksum formula coincides with the number estimated. If the number does not tally, I can plus-minus until I get the correct checksum. Alternatively, I could iterate from 0 to the number of babies born that year. Given that SG live births is < 50,000 per year on average, realistically I would only need to iterate 50 times. As a final verification, I could PayNow to the NRIC number.

As I reflect on the developments, I realize that the perception of NRIC secrecy has undergone significant changes over the years.**Background: The Shifting Landscape of NRIC Secrecy**Growing up in the 90s, I recall that NRIC numbers were not as heavily guarded as they are today. As a class/ CCA representative, I had access to a list of my classmates' unmasked NRIC numbers to take attendance. However, even then, there is a perception on the privacy of NRIC. I recall my grandparents and parents always cautioned me against sharing my NRIC number, citing the risk of loan sharks.**The PDPA and the Masking of NRIC**With the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the subsequent masking of NRIC numbers around 2019, the government emphasized the importance of protecting personal data. This move reinforced the notion that NRIC numbers are sensitive information to the general public.**Observations and Concerns**Despite the government's efforts to protect NRIC numbers, several observations raise concerns about the effectiveness of these measures:1. *Widespread distribution of NRIC numbers:* Prior to the PDPA and masking of NRIC numbers, these numbers were freely distributed, making it likely that they can still be found on older documents.2. *Formula of NRIC numbers:* The structure of NRIC numbers includes 'S' for those born before 2000 and 'T' for those born on or after 2000. The first two digits indicate the birth year (for the majority), and the next five digits represent the time of registration. This, coupled with the fact that the alphabet in NRIC numbers follows a fixed formula, makes it relatively easy to approximate a person's NRIC number, especially when combined with the last three digits and the alphabet.3. *NRIC numbers used for authentication:* Currently they are widely used as authentication details for government agencies and banks.4. *Public perception of NRIC secrecy:* The majority of Singaporeans view their NRIC numbers as secret and private information, often using them as passwords or for other private purposes.**The Dissonance Between Perception and Reality**These observations highlight a clear dissonance between the public's perception of NRIC secrecy and the reality of its vulnerability. This disconnect creates a false sense of comfort, which may lead to increased data theft.**Complications Arising from the New Regulation**The government's decision to move away from masking NRIC numbers raises several complications:1. *New authentication details:* The number one concern for everyone will be: what will the new authentication details be? Should the entire authentication process be revamped? The truth is, most authentication details (e.g., date of birth, address, mother's maiden name, etc.) are not exactly private information, but they are not public either. Using a sufficient number of data points should create a certain comfort level to take specific actions. These thresholds should definitely be set by the government with clear guidelines.2. *Balancing transparency and security :* While NRIC numbers may not be entirely private, making them publicly available may not be necessary or beneficial. In this regard, I am unable to understand the enhanced trust and transparency mentioned by the Government.**Conclusion**In conclusion, while reducing reliance on NRIC numbers as private information may be a positive step, it is essential to address the deeply ingrained perception of NRIC secrecy in the population. The government must clearly communicate the rationale and implications of the new regulation, ensuring a smooth transition and alleviating public concerns.**Side Notes**1. *Government communication :* The government's communication on this issue has been piecemeal and incoherent, leaving many wondering about the details particularly the intention of this new move.2. *Inter-agency coordination:* The lack of coordination between government agencies, as evident in the ACRA incident, highlights the need for improved communication and alignment.",Legal,-0.6,0.9,0.8,0.9963,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hgr3qh/my_view_on_the_whole_nric_saga/,Reddit,2024-12-18 02:03:00,"My view on the whole NRIC saga **The Evolution of NRIC Secrecy in Singapore**The recent controversy surrounding the new NRIC regulation has sparked intense debate.

Sheltered walkway from bus stop doesn’t link directly to main hospital building (see pics 3 & 4)**The sheltered walkway from Alexandra Road goes through a garden but also doesn’t connect directly to the main hospital block.**Caveat**: I’m not a construction professional, but the thoughtless nature of the sheltered walkway design seems to be more a slipshod effort than anything else.
