t3_1g7yv3h,Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System,"In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones. This approach is creating significant issues, particularly when people have their eyes on a specific project but are forced to consider other projects within the same estate. For example, the recent BTO launch includes 3 bundled Bedok projects (2 Bayshore sites and 1 Kembangan site) and 3 bundled Kallang/Whampoa sites (1 Lavender site, 1 Whampoa site, 1 Upper Boon Keng site). Applicants do not have the option to ballot for a single site; they must enter the ballot for all sites in the same bundle.# 1. ""Forced to Choose"" to avoid New Penalty RulesOne of the primary issues is that applicants aiming for a specific project are automatically entered into a ballot for every project in the estate. If they fail to get a favorable queue number for their desired project, they may be forced to choose from other projects that they may have no real interest in. Otherwise, theyll have to face a one-year wait-out penalty where they are barred from balloting again.This creates an undesirable situation where applicants must either settle for a less appealing project just to avoid the penalty, or be locked out of the system for a year. Its not just about getting lucky in the current state, even ""average luck"" wont suffice if applicants are aiming for highly sought-after projects. Let's look at the current BTO exercise as an example: those who are interested in Crawford Heights (prime location with only 234 4R units) are currently competing with 1,880 other applicants, meaning only about the top 15% will secure a unit at Crawford Heights, while the rest must choose between the other two projects (Towner Breeze and Kallang View) or face the one-year penalty. Now this used to be less of an issue in previous exercises where projects were bundled together as an estate. For example October 2023's Kallang/Whampoa BTO launch also had 3 different sites bundled together, and while one is a PLH, the other two are standard flats with 5 year MOP. If applicants were not able to select their desired PLH flat, they could still choose either of the standard flats and only serve a 5-year MOP. This provided applicants with a valuable safety net: if they could not secure their preferred PLH flat, they still had the option to select one of the standard flats and only commit to a 5-year MOP, allowing for greater flexibility in their housing decisions. Not to mention, these standard flats came with no restrictions, were still situated in prime areas, and held significant potential profit after just 5 years. Unfortunately, all Kallang/Whampoa projects in the current exercise are at least Plus flats, and have a 10 year MOP. This means that applicants could potentially be locked into a longer commitment in a home they might not genuinely want. Whether due to job relocations, changes in family size, or shifts in personal preferences, being tied to a property for such an extended period can severely limit options.**2. Pitfalls of Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)**The MCPS is designed to encourage applicants to live near their parents by granting them an extra ballot chance for projects located close to their parents' homes. However, in large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, the geographic spread of available projects can be quite vast. This creates a situation where people aiming for a specific project near their parents may find themselves instead needing to consider another project that is far from them.Moreover, applicants can apply for this scheme as long as at least one of the units bundled together is near their parents, thereby birthing a potential loophole in this scheme whereby applicants can use their proximity advantage to gain a better chance for a project that is not actually near their parents. For instance, someone who qualifies for the scheme because their parents live near Project A could use that extra ballot chance to select a unit in Project B, even if Project B is far from their parents (assuming both Project A and B are lumped into the same estate). This undermines the original purpose of the scheme, which is meant to facilitate closer family living, not provide an unfair advantage for unrelated projects.**3. Neglecting Locational Differences and Individual Needs** Lumping multiple projects into a single estate-wide ballot fails to account for both the geographical spread and applicants' individual preferences. In large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, projects can be located far apart, making it unfair to treat them as one choice. Applicants aiming for a specific location may end up balloting for projects that are not as conveniently located. This approach also disregards varied personal prioritieswhether it's proximity to work, family, or access to amenitiesreducing the process to simply securing a unit, rather than finding a home that meets their specific needs. In light of these issues, one must wonder why HDB continue to implement this bundled ballot system. While the intention may be to streamline the application process and increase efficiency, it raises serious concerns about fairness and the ability of Singaporeans to secure homes that genuinely meet their needs. As the housing landscape evolves, it is essential for HDB to consider these implications and adapt its approach to better serve the diverse needs of its BTO applicants.",Housing,0.95,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7yv3h/exposing_a_huge_flaw_in_the_current_bto_balloting/,Reddit,2024-10-20 21:36:19,"Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones.

Also, construction time is largely dictated by HDB/MND.

I hope most ppl actually read this b4 i see another post on lane splitting. Ill try to explain some common points n yall can add/ask more.1) Lane splitting is illegal. No its not illegal, TP,LTA n other enforcement uses it so its ofc not illegal. Driving schools will tell u its a grey area so u do it at ur discretion (smthg like discretionary right turn)2) Ban lane splitting. If u think the current traffic isnt bad enough n u want even longer traffic sure go suggest to ur MP. Personally i feel like if someone can benefit from the space, why not. Just because i am stuck in jam doesnt mean everyone has to get stuck in jam. Thats just resentment.3) Lane splitting is not safe. Yes n No. The main issue with lane splitting is that it was never taught properly so for most riders its monkey see monkey do. This makes it very dangerous especially for newer riders(no experience) n older riders (no reflex). Once u have ridden for a certain no. Of years there will be rules u make (dont go too fast, only lane split between lane 1 n 2, keep a distance from the front, inch out b4 merging into lane splitting lane etc.)4) why is lane splitting safer? Motorcycles (smaller cc) have weaker braking power than cars so if there happens to be an accident/ebrake (common in sg), they cant avoid it. Why not go at a safe distance? Well if u drive in sg, a safe distance equals to impatient ppl cutting u off which makes it more dangerous. Also being able to see whats in front makes it much safer. Imagine driving in between 2 trucks vs driving between 2 cars.5) why do most riders lane split recklessly? Well like i said this is because it wasnt taught properly n maybe they r influenced by out JB riders which do it regularly. Malaysia has a higher presence of motorcycles which makes their drivers more careful hence they can be more reckless.6) Why do riders cut queue? Because they lane split to the front, it doesnt make sense to stay in the lane splitting lane when static as they r in the blindspot of the vehicles. They also put other riders at the back in danger as not all vehicles will move off straight.

Motorcycles (smaller cc) have weaker braking power than cars so if there happens to be an accident/ebrake (common in sg), they cant avoid it. Why not go at a safe distance? Well if u drive in sg, a safe distance equals to impatient ppl cutting u off which makes it more dangerous. Also being able to see whats in front makes it much safer. Imagine driving in between 2 trucks vs driving between 2 cars.5) why do most riders lane split recklessly? Well like i said this is because it wasnt taught properly n maybe they r influenced by out JB riders which do it regularly. Malaysia has a higher presence of motorcycles which makes their drivers more careful hence they can be more reckless.6) Why do riders cut queue? Because they lane split to the front, it doesnt make sense to stay in the lane splitting lane when static as they r in the blindspot of the vehicles. They also put other riders at the back in danger as not all vehicles will move off straight. Usually most riders dont play phone n motorcycles have better pickup than cars so most will zoom off after green causing not much invonvenience. From my experience, i usually will cross the junction b4 the first car starts moving.Extra: Lane splitting is also dangerous due to drivers mentality in sg. Most dont signal n check blindspot when changing lanes. They also do the swerve lane change instead of gradual lane change. Another issue is lane sharing, drivers can give more space to make lane splitting more smoother (right lane stay more to the right n left lane stay more to the left) but most dont.In summary it can be safe/graceful if drivers n riders understand each other but in sg when everyone is selfish/entitled otr this issue will most likely stay till the future.",-0.6236019865512847,negative,-0.7699384232997895,negative

I submitted a report to OneService and gotten a typical response from LTA that they will monitor and take action if necessary. So the bottom line is, it doesn't matter if you are foreigners or locals. Unfortunately the state of our government now, especially for agencies such as LTA, MND, is, they will not take concrete action unless it is an instruction from the top. All the feedback channels are mostly for show only.|you ain't alone,, if we could, we would've done it earlier.|Totally agree man, especially those clowns that make a loud bang sound like their engine just blew up.|Doubt theyll take any action even if youre local |As a local, I encourage you to write in to Traffic Police n LTA to report this.And of cos, if you identified the bikes.

Revving car engines needs to be a capital crime with constant enforcement, like the punishment for drugs in singapore|Maybe try meeting your MP at their regular meet-the-people sessions?|I wrote before that reporting loud exhaust has mixed success, because there are loud exhaust systems that are actually legal. (Why are these allowed to be legal? Idk, ask LTA.) LTA views reporting for noise as lower priority because there is a chance the exhaust system is legal, therefore the complaint is non-legit and waste of their time.So it was suggested that when you report, you need to say something like ""**strong smell of exhaust gasses, suspected removal of catalytic converter**"". This will trigger LTA to inspect them, because removal of catconverter is 100% illegal. Some car owners will then go to a workshop to pay to swap in legal parts, then after the inspection they will swap back to the illegal parts. So what you have to do is **repeatedly report them to LTA, saying they got new illegal parts** (which is technically true since they swap in after inspection), until the cost of doing swapping is too high for them and they give up.|I often wonder how they're not deaf sitting on the vehicle itself and being so close to the engine.|Useless no life punks showing off their overpriced cars and bikes|maybe you can go to your areas meet the people session and talk to the mp about it directly? usually thats how you get stuff fielded in parliament (by pestering your mp about it until they listen)|[removed]|Preach to the choir.

I would like to see the positions of tobacco and vapes be reversed in the law meanwhile strongly promoting alternatives that help smokers quit smoking.If this is not possible, then setting up of smoking boxes and all smokers must smoke only in there. Any smokers caught outside will be fined and if enforcement is an issue, then snitches can report smokers who violate this new law and get a portion of the fine as a reward. As much as I don't want to encourage snitching, I'm more sick of unwanted 2nd hand smoke.|Second hand smoke is RAMPANT in HDB estates. The fact youre not receiving feedback is because people are unaware of the reporting mechanism, or have zero faith in it. It does NOT indicate a lack of a problem - the problem is alive and well|It can also show NEA feedback platform has little success. Therefore the feedback participation rate dropped over the years as people realised its going nowhere.|Egg lady Khor has always been disappointing in her public responses. To me, she is really Jo Teo #2, completely out of touch.|The amount of feedback is declining, because we report it again and again and again initially. But nothing is done. So why the hell do we continue to report?? If NEA wants more online reports on second hand smoke, I will be more than happy to send at least 3 every night.|Declining feedback coz they probably know give feedback/complain also no point not like NEA will do anything|vote wisely guys|Feedback, no feedback the result is still the same so why bother. I gave up years ago, and am **praying** to a god I don't believe that when I move my neighbors aren't complete cunts.Maybe in younger estates it ain't much of an issue, but I live in a mature neighborhood and it's like no one gives a fuck. Everyday like clockwork I have to close the windows to my room as the neighbor LOVES smoking outside their god damn house, directly in front of my open window. So if there's wind, I'm fucked, and there's always wind because I live on the 12th floor.That's just chemical pollution. Noise pollution from them owning a dog, and yet have zero training. Shit you not, that dog barks at everyone. Their solution to the problem? Shout louder than the dog telling it to shut up. Then there's their plants and random furniture lining the fking walls like they own the entire space.And of course, the nightmare neighbors are friends. At least I'm not paired with the worst one, as my fellow innocent floor neighbor is just completely fucked. Their next door neighbor LITERALLY ignored their space, and just filled the surrounding area with their BS. To the point where they, who reside in the farthest unit, has shit piled up ALL the way to the damn lift lobby. It has literally become a storage area for them. Random fucking furniture, random boxes of junk, random fking chairs to drink beer and smoke. I give up lah. It's LITERALLY like talking to a brick wall. Feedback is fucking useless if nothing is done.|There are 820000 smokers in sg. Imagine the tax getting collected.|Maybe people gave up in reporting?|Not enough. Many people don't even know the law exists. I had to lie to my dad just last week that a friend of mine was caught smoking at corridor in order to stop him from doing so because I don't live with them and cannot monitor. I then checked with my mum and both of them had no idea it is illegal.|The problem is... you report liao then?Smokers want to smoke.Either they smoke in their own house, or they smoke in corridors. Cannot run one. You push them even more they get even angrier and start becoming aggressive. It's an addiction after all.Lee Bee Wah actually had an interesting idea to build smoking pavilions to make smokers congregate in one spot so that they wouldn't smoke everywhere else. Sadly, due to a lack of support and enforcement, the pavilion now stands empty while smokers still smoke everywhere they please.So... I don't see a solution to this problem. But I'm glad Louis is bringing up all the more relevant issues since the other members seem to not be doing so.|Tax cigarettes even more, it's too cheap for the harm it does.|Hell, my neighbor even dared me to call the police to complain about their smoking and said even the police couldnt do shit about it.|Swept under the rug. You dont see it, there is no issue, right? Right?

Buying food from those external stalls becomes a test of my breath holding skills.|In addition to second hand cigarette smoke, another issue is the smoke from joss/incense sticks burnt in the HDB corridor. I have observed that many HDB flats have a small shrine outside their door where they light joss sticks. Unfortunately the smoke and smell is blown indoors into the neighbouring flats and not everyone likes the smoke and smell.I tried to look up online and seems like people are expected to be understanding of these practices as it is multi-religious society. However, the smoke from incense sticks increases the SPM in the air and might lead to adverse health effects. From a public health point of view, it's something which I feel should not be allowed. People can of course do these rituals inside their home or at a temple.|[removed]|Actually, whats with the inconsistency. There was a recent case which the court dictated that a certain couple could no longer smoke in their homes because of the health impact on their neighbour.Either this applies to all, or dont have such a thing at all, no?|Bump.. hate cigar smoke from one of the neighbours|Are you gonna send it to Louis Ng like he asked for or just posting it on Reddit?|SG gov only scared of one thing. Reputation damage. I can identity 2 ways to push for solutions to second hand smoke.First, start a petition. Gather signatures of Singaporeans who are affected by this issue, which is ALOT. I estimate 100,000, given the number of HDBs and smokers in SG.Second. Spam this in every single online platform you find. Reddit is a good start. Also for news sites which allows for comments. Anything related to SG in foreign press? Spam this. SG donating foreign aid to other countries? Spam how they can afford to help foreigners but cannot help their locals dying from second-hand smoke. SG won Olympic medal? Spam how it's because the athlete didn't have second hand smoke damaging his lungs when he was a kid. Essentially frame everything SG to this topic.If you can write well, write OPs to foreign papers. Malaysia and Indonesia news agencies will be happy to report how many more Singaporeans are dying of second-hand smoke compared to their own countries.When enough of this happens, it is guaranteed that the SG gov will fix it. Things only get fixed in SG when enough attention is focused on it.|If you have LinkedIn, and agree with Louis Ng, do comment or like his post for traction|I quit smoking 2 years ago.My question is, how many people died from 2nd hand smoke ? I want the statistics please. Thanks. Yes i did quit smoking cos I'm 60 and I'm starting to jog again.|My issue is that I smell the smoke but cannot locate the source even thought I tried several times.

No point to score. The civil servant is also just running it thru like for the sake of their work. Pasting poster at lobby is not going to stop them smoking. There is never any intent to solve this problem. I have been talking for 20 years from HDB to TC to NEA and all yield no positive outcome. The situation did not improve one bit. The smoker is still puffing away at the windows. Anyway, it is also a very difficult or nearly no solution to this problem. You cannot ask the addict to stop smoking at the window. They know smoking will kill them but it is an addiction. So, the only way out of this is either the smoker die first or you go first. Slowly....!|This guy gets it|Thank you OP for rallying!|I think the ""declining trend"" comes from the fact that most people just gave up complaining because they know it's a waste of time+effort and nothing will be done. HDB will say that neighbours are smoking on private premises and refuse to act (except issue a useless advisory) and town council will say it's not a ""prohibited"" area. There's a so-called OneService app where I'd submitted photos of smoke drifting up from the window downstairs right through my own bedroom window directly above. 2yrs, multiple complaints via various channels, saw MP, nothing worked. I moved out. But that was my parents' place, and they have to keep the bedroom window shut all the time even in sweltering heat despite the typically breezy environment, since said neighbour smokes any day, anytime.|Joke.

Vaping also seems to be the new coping mechanism vice for the younger generation. My neighbour (\~23?) vapes openly right outside his home. Once during one of the holidays, they had friends/family over and two were smoking at the staircase (no door; old flat) right next to the lift landing. My mum told them off and asked them to smoke elsewhere. They simply acknowledged but continued to smoke. As for daily occurrences, i think my other neighbour has the lungs of a blue whale or something. He/she/they is/are perpetually smoking and i mean it. I'm awake between 12am to 6am and i can smell the smoke during those hours. During the day, my family are the ones who smells it. Really quite hard to pinpoint who the smoker(s) is/are, cos we're aware that the two floors directly below us aren't smokers at all. And since mine's old flat with lift only going to 4 floors, we hardly see the other neighbours (since they go to a different floor altogether) so we have no idea who's smoking. Every time we smell it we just loudly announce, right by the windows, that we smell it.anyway while we're at this, is there a way to really stop smokers from puffing while they are walking? or those people who smokes right next to a bus stop?? new enforceable law?? i once remember someone coming up with some kind of tech to detect smoke and when it's detected, the windows would automatically shut?? could any lurking PM pick up this idea, propose, provide funding for the project or something especially for people with medical problems (or generally for the more vulnerable group)? it doesn't even have to be permanent, just a contraption where a team can head to the vulnerable's home, set it up and collect it after x months/years. sincerely, a frustrated non-smoker citizen|I hate second hand smoke.

High level, we are hit with people smoking out of their houses. I am not sure about others, but this is my daily life right now. My windows are always closed, I have but a 1 hour window to quickly air out my home and then I close it again.Right now in the current Singapore weather, there is NO WIND to move the smoke.

They littered the area with cigarette butts and the floors are black. I reported on oneservice app and it got bounced around by HDB and NEA. After weeks NEA called me to say they are helpless as smoking is at random times of the day and they ate unable to place anyone just to catch people smoking. They asked me to snap photos or videos of them. Can u believe this? They want me to snitch on myself so the neighbours all hate me?Later on they called again to ask me the only other way is to write a report and bring it to court.After this I just gave up reporting.

This is ridiculous|At my office building, there's an inconsiderate dude from another unit who keeps smoking at the handicap toilet. Probably 2-3 times a day. Unfortunately, my office is near the toilet so his smoke drifts into my office and i can even smell the smoke from my seat. Whenever i walk by the toilet when he smokes, my hair immediately smells like smoke afterwards. I even caught him walking out from the handicap toilet once after smoking and it looks like a sauna in there. I have complained to the management office twice, who have since spoken to him about it, but he still continues to smoke. I really really hope there be something NEA can do about people smoking in undesignated areas :/|Im fine with smoker being around.

The secondhand smoke is affecting my elderly mom till the point where we had to close all kitchen and toilet windows. The smoke also left a strong smell on all our laundry. I talked to my neighbors both upstairs and downstairs and they mentioned smelling the smoke too but seemed uninterested in taking any action.

The answer is a resounding NO. Smoke spreads, so even if the smoker is trying to be considerate and smoking outside, the air in a 25 meter radius around them is contaminated. Experienced it many times before. Completely agree that smoking should be banned everywhere except for a few smoking spots where even the smoke travelling far from the cigarette wont affect a passerby.|[removed]|Im living at 2-3rd floor of a HDB.

Do they assume that no kids are living in low floor? And my neighbor is a old Malay lady that have health problem. Could we just enforce a non-smoking corridor for HDB too, we low floor dweller does not deserve these kind of harassment.|So if we can stop people from smoking in their own homes, can we stop people burning incense in the corridor?

Let's say there is really a category to complain about 2nd hand smoke. The person is smoking at his window, smoke is drifting up into other homes. In the first place, there is no law that one can't smoke at their window. So if you complain, all TC/HDB can do is advise the neighbor to don't do that. And if they don't bother, it is a capital LAN, LAN. Therefore, Mr Louis Ng is; to me; wayang action only. He should know better and the effort is to propose a Bill to ban smoking at one's own home opened window. Which he bloody damn well know, it will be shot down the moment he proposes it internally to his bosses. (Side note; the PAP received severe backlash from bringing into law, folks who are naked with their windows open). As what a person does in their own home is private (without breaking any laws).In short, there needs to be a law, or maybe an enforceable regulation (which requires some law or rule) to be in place before an","Louis Ng on Secondhand Smoke Louis Ng spreading the word on secondhand smoke.

FIRST, no one uses NEA online feedback anymore, most will use OneService to report smoking. This means the number of reports on NEA website is bound to drop. 2. SECOND, OneService recently disabled smoke complaints when it drifts into your window.

I am going to be honest, I didnt know what was wrong about it at first, and even thought it appropriate to use once in a while.But now as I grow older, I keep seeing its use spread, not only amongst those who typically use it, but also by people who are supposedly well read and better educated than the common folk, journalists.This greatly shocked me, as I truly believed that these people were supposedly to a standard of morality and insight for the rest of us to understand the world from.This entire situation greatly disgusts me, and I believe its time to end the use of the R word, as well as call out those who shamelessly use it both in casual as well as professional settings. This means it should no longer appear in statistics, parliamentary speeches, news reports and national policy.The year 2024 ends in a little over a month, and let us hope, the word resident with it.",-0.20084355835914613,negative,-0.2265170014858246,negative

As a fellow jogger, Ive also experienced being temporarily blinded by these lights, especially when they are not angled properly. The situation is even worse with flashing or strobing lights, which can be very disorienting. While I understand the need for cyclists to have bright lights for their safety, it would be great if they could adjust the angle, use lower settings in well-lit areas, or avoid using flashing modes when on shared paths.|Cannot understand people who install/always use high beam while cycling.

I have not faced any issues with them.|As a cyclist myself, I keep my lights pointed down. But if some wanker comes along with highbeam (cylist/pmd) I will angle the light right in their face.It's very confrontational (and very obvious that it's intentional, since I'll push the light mount to point it upwards), but it should get the point across.|Whenever I see this and they're approaching at a speed where I cannot ensure my safety, I will raise my arm to use my hand to block the light from my eyes.And of course by sheer coincidence the arm I raise will be the one closest to them with my elbow sticking out.If they want to come close at high speed, they risk getting an elbow right in the face.|They really lack critical thinking and perspective, just thinking from their own pov.

It just leaves me disappointed. You think they would say ""oh yeah, this light is distracting others. I should change it"".|They are clueless and angle the lights to shone 180 degrees ahead instead of a few metres At The Ground.|Crazy bright lights are cheap, a single crappy one runs like $10. Anti-glare lights are expensive. Real StVZO compliant lights are costly, running about $100 or so. Angling it at the ground doesn't help much: the cyclist wants to illuminate the path ahead, not their front wheel. If they point their lights down, then to see the path ahead, they crank the brightness way up, and we're back where we started: with stray light flying everywhere to dazzle every eyeball it can reach. It's absolutely necessary to have shaped reflectors and opaque cutoffs, not just adapt a torchlight: the misunderstanding that one can just point lights downwards is part of the problem.Even if one wants to opt out of the brightness wars, a lot of lights sold on Lazada/Shopee are just straight up lying on whether they have a cutoff line to avoid blinding oncoming traffic. If the light doesn't have a shaped reflector: they are lying. If the light doesn't set back the LED quite deep into the torch: they are lying. If there are multiple LEDs: they are lying.

Here I experienced 2 different health coverage companies, and a premium coverage for one of them. My current one is from my own pocket, not provided by the job. In case it is relevant, I am a foreigner, experienced the SG system for the last 12 years, and I don't have any cpf. My experience is probably different from citizens and PRs.From my insurances companies: Glasses and dental health are not covered, and should be. Who can have a healthy life without seeing properly? Also, preexisting conditions such as asthma, eczema, allergies increase my monthly insurance fees by around 30% of the global coverage price, each (!). It's then less expensive to buy medication from my own pocket. Both contraception and pregnancy are not covered, or for a huge expensive extra. You want kids, you pay. You don't want kids, you pay. Maybe birth rates would increase if there were more pregnancy related coverage? Also, imo, unfair to the ladies who need contraception for hormonal diseases. Mental health. Ridiculous cap, huge needs. Now I have been hospitalised, had surgery, went to the a&e, have pre existing diseases and had to get lots of specialist consultations (all in public hospitals), and I experienced an efficient organized system, with generally good quality services and docs. Lots of docs are quick at prescribing the hard stuff, and wanna treat the symptoms asap, which is good, but they rarely spend time on the cause. They see you for 15min, give you antibiotics, and you pay 100sgd. I guess it's harder to take the time to help each single patient thoroughly in a big crowded city .But in general I had good experiences.|Everyone wants good coverage. Best coverage. Covers everything. Make it easy to claim. But premium must remain low. Cannot profit kay?|No it isn't bad. What is bad is the CEO killing in cold blood thousands of his customers. Period.Just desserts|1. Pre existing conditions. I have someone close who is excluded from ISP due to a lab test result which could put him at a higher risk of 1 cancer, it's hereditary so not within his control. Pre existing condition denial mean that there will be a group of our population who suffer lifetime worse financial and health outcomes. The better way is to mandate everyone get private insurance without pre-existing conditions and spread the risk (as the purpose of insurance is risk pooling) or have a single national insurance program2. Insurance agents: insurance agents and the fact that we don't have a national insurance program adds a cost. Go google ""integrated shield plan distribution cost"". ISP distribution cost is 12%, some is even higher at almost 30%. Which means on avg, everyone's IP plan is 12% to 30% more expensive in their lifetime because there are these distribution cost. Now I get that because there are claims and claims are difficult, that's why agents get paid to service their clients. But if the system is different with a national insurance where there isn't a claim system (the doctor acts as the gatekeeper of medical services instead of the insurers), then there are much less need for claims and thus don't need agents, and there you find savings.Of course, this won't happen because insurance and insurance agents are a powerful industry in our country.|Shooting a guy with a family what relevance is that to a shooting???|The fact that insurers can keep increasing shield plan prices without any limits or regulation.

Its important to note how the American system is broken, because therere several factors at play. Understanding these factors also helps us avoid those problem locally, and informs us on what we would want from the healthcare system. 1. America has does not have a single payer system. Each healthcare company or a vertically integrated company like United Healthcare negotiates their own rates for medication with the Pharma companies. This causes several problems. You pay more for the medication. In a single payer system, a national entity negotiates the medication rates for the entire population and actively pits the pharma companies against each other with a cost-benefit analysis to meet a specific medical need. The pharma companies lower their prices, due to competition and due to the fact a single payer is able to offer a longer term contracts which offers longer demand and profit assurance. Pharma companies also save on direct marketing costs to consumers, which is significant in the American market. (Something youre starting to see in SG, its not a good thing. If youre seeing a mp- this is what you should bring up. Direct marketing to consumer by Pharma company imo is dangerous. The opioid crisis in America was started through direct marketing. Not having a single payer also exposes the healthcare system to influences beyond medical needs. It allows the consumer to pick their medication based on marketing influences, which is also why Pharma companies in America have a huge marketing budget, the cost of which is passed onto the consumer. I recall Singapore does have a something like a drug board, which you mentioned, which purchases drugs on behalf of the national healthcare system. Its one reason why polyclinics drugs are cheaper than private clinics. It keeps the sales people out of the conversation where they should be. Medical treatment and drug purchases should be judged on cost vs efficacy analysis. The analysis is very technical, which is why we need professionals help us decide. Preferably professionals paid for by the state, and not serving some vested interests. 2. You will have a subpar treatment experience. It creates situations where the healthcare company would offer subpar medication or suboptimal medication and force the patient to accept that treatment due the better rates negotiated with the Pharma company compared to other drugs. The treatment is now not based on treatment efficacy , but a cost driven decision, which a profit driven company would choose the cheapest, even if its the worse treatment. United Healthcare was guilty of this. The insurance companies are not legally obligated to cover the treatment best suited for you. Just to stipulated 3. Not having single payer allows more bloat to creep into the healthcare system. Your point about insurance agents is one good example. It increases the administrative costs of maintaining the healthcare system. It also creates a situation where the increasing administrative costs of denying or delaying treatment is acceptable, as it is cheaper compared to treating the patient. (Delay, Deny, Dispose). 4. The healthcare insurance industry is often poorly regulated. The American system especially allows the insurance company to have a say on the treatment options. 5. CEOs having a disproportionate salary is nothing new. I mean, our country probably has the largest salary gap between the top government official and the entry civil servant, in a developed nation. United Healthcare CEOs having a large remuneration package is not the issue. The fact that United healthcare has the highest denial rates in their nation and forces lower efficacy treatments on their customers is. 6. For all its flaws, the American system does attract the best treatments because of the amount of money in their healthcare industry. The money there attracts some of the best engineers and scientists in drug development. Its not a coincidence that they were the first to develop the COVID vaccines to the production stage. The Pharma logistics chain is administratively heavy, hence long and slow. The fact they could deliver the vaccine so quickly (development+ production) is indicative of the talent.|I'd rather see an insurance (hospitalisation etc) that can have multiple paying party.I had my own insurance which is duplicate with the company insurance, but no choice cos otherwise if I'm jobless i have no coverage.What about having a nationally mandated insurance which employer can pay up for, or top up for higher tier or cover if they wish and then if I'm retrenched or in between jobs i pay to it myself?|The gaps are dental, mental and maternity cover. Dental and maternity are almost a must have for human s but its your own out of pocket expense.","Healthcare Insurance in Singapore Ok, this is in light of the suspected UHC CEO killer getting arrested, his manifesto being published online etc. Before I begin, I think we can agree that shooting a guy with a family in the back on the streets is bad. We can also agree that the healthcare system in the US is f\*cked. Both can be true at the same time. Don't listen to people telling you that you need to pick a side. Back to Singapore. I've seen a lot of comments in the wake of the shooting and arrest saying that Singapore's healthcare system is ""almost perfect"" etc. While our general healthcare system is very, very good, it's not perfect. What do you guys think are the general gaps in our healthcare insurance coverage? And would it make economic sense (because increased coverage means more expensive policies for everyone...usually) to plug these gaps? Do insurance agents and CEOs here, for example, earn too much proportionate to their effort and social benefits they provide? I'll start by saying that I think we should have limited coverage for psychiatric medication. We should also look at insurance covering things like sleep apnea machines. Both these things can help when your life isn't threatened but will help your general health in the long-term, leading to less claims in the future. Also, what do you think about having centralized drug stores? This model makes it so that medical practitioners don't profit directly off the medications they prescribe, thereby giving them less incentive to over-prescribe drugs.",0.024481283426284806,neutral,0.05243134226799012,neutral

Singapore is a very young country that has gone through significant changes in the last half of the century. Also the transition from mother tongue to English as the predominant language used in business. Just look at the statistics for percentage of degree holders across the different generations. The increase in sophistication in our economy and the increased globalisation that Singapore is exposed to.

Honestly, I was so angry afterwards that I wished I didnt side step, let them knock me and I will police report and sue them.|They should expect the right of way too. The users should wait like everyone else.|No one's tried a ""Change My View"" response yet, so at the risk of an avalanche of downvotes, here it goes:**Liu Thai Ker, considered the architect of modern Singapore**, has called the failure to develop smaller lanes into our roads and street network **his greatest regret**: increased usage of e-bikes, e-scooters, and LEVs/PMDs proves that there's a real demand for **affordable micro-mobility options**. Most countries, including Singapore, have failed to build sufficient cycling/LEV/PMD infrastructure to meet this demand. The Dutch are a notable exception: the long term, we'll need **fewer cars and more LEVs/PMDs in Singapore**. We will regret not investing in better micro-mobility infrastructure, because like it or not, Light Electric Vehicles will be a significant component of future urban transportation.Singapore could be the world's leader in micro-mobility. If the Netherlands can do it, then surely we can: They also need to top up a few other things1.) single seaters only seen a family of 4 lazy people riding one.2.) CAN ONLY BE SOLD TO REAL PHYSICAL DISABLED PEOPLE! Meaning a doctors approval is required, not lazy delivery driver you know who you are slapping a disabled logo on the back of the seat and you are not.3.) Must be sold as chair type only with 4 wheels, no more 3 wheel handle bar driving style. Controlled using single hand joy stick style only.4.) finally can only go as fast as a human being can walk, the point of the wheel chair was to bring back mobility to those who cant walk, not replace the speed of running or riding a back.Wish SG law makers would get off their ass and solve this problem before Singapore turns into the end of wall-e with all these lazy people.|Yeah, you're not the first to say this. The good thing is, the speed limit of PMAs will come into effect in 2025. And, I know it doesn't seem like it but the rules do get enforced quite well actually. As a grabfood rider, I've seen LTA officers camp at different areas so many times. But I mean, it's just those few troublemakers who somehow find a way to evade the police.|Already in the works: [ should also a speed floor on roads. Nothing less than 1km/s|All the other comments here aren't trying to CYV, so I'll try to do it in the spirit of that sub.I would argue that eWheelchairs should be limited to walking speed in most cases, but there should be an allowance for them to speed up slightly for a short period is time. For example, they should be allowed to go at say 1.5 tonnes walking speed for 1 minute at a time, with a 10min cool down between uses. (Note the exact timing and speed can be debated, but I'm just arguing for this concept of a short burst of speed boost with some sort of cool down.)The reason I think this is necessary is due to 'emergencies' or small unforeseen circumstances. For example when crossing the road, the wheelchair user may not be the first in the queue (ie they're not right at the roadside, but instead further back from the road) so if they're only able to go at walking speed they may not be able to cross a multi lane road within the timing of the green man. Another example, when crossing the road it may be crowded so they have to give way to others by slowing down or taking a less direct path across the road. Then they'll need to speed up in order to cross before the red man. More far fetched examples are if they need to escape from stray dogs chasing them, or they need to evacuated from a burning building - it would be useful to be able to go faster than walking speed.So my point is they should not be absolutely limited to walking speed. They should be allowed to go faster in certain cases, but there should be measures that prevent abuse of this right.|Should more heavily regulate/ban them in MRT. Its completely ridiculous especially when their riders are reckless and selfish.|New speed limit for PMA - 0.05km/h. Anything faster and you get an EMP blast that fuses the rider to the device.

This move reinforced the notion that NRIC numbers are sensitive information to the general public.**Observations and Concerns**Despite the government's efforts to protect NRIC numbers, several observations raise concerns about the effectiveness of these measures:1. *Widespread distribution of NRIC numbers:* Prior to the PDPA and masking of NRIC numbers, these numbers were freely distributed, making it likely that they can still be found on older documents.2. *Formula of NRIC numbers:* The structure of NRIC numbers includes 'S' for those born before 2000 and 'T' for those born on or after 2000. The first two digits indicate the birth year (for the majority), and the next five digits represent the time of registration. This, coupled with the fact that the alphabet in NRIC numbers follows a fixed formula, makes it relatively easy to approximate a person's NRIC number, especially when combined with the last three digits and the alphabet.3. *NRIC numbers used for authentication:* Currently they are widely used as authentication details for government agencies and banks.4. *Public perception of NRIC secrecy:* The majority of Singaporeans view their NRIC numbers as secret and private information, often using them as passwords or for other private purposes.**The Dissonance Between Perception and Reality**These observations highlight a clear dissonance between the public's perception of NRIC secrecy and the reality of its vulnerability. This disconnect creates a false sense of comfort, which may lead to increased data theft.**Complications Arising from the New Regulation**The government's decision to move away from masking NRIC numbers raises several complications:1. *New authentication details:* The number one concern for everyone will be: what will the new authentication details be? Should the entire authentication process be revamped? The truth is, most authentication details (e.g., date of birth, address, mother's maiden name, etc.) are not exactly private information, but they are not public either. Using a sufficient number of data points should create a certain comfort level to take specific actions. These thresholds should definitely be set by the government with clear guidelines.2. *Balancing transparency and security :* While NRIC numbers may not be entirely private, making them publicly available may not be necessary or beneficial. In this regard, I am unable to understand the enhanced trust and transparency mentioned by the Government.**Conclusion**In conclusion, while reducing reliance on NRIC numbers as private information may be a positive step, it is essential to address the deeply ingrained perception of NRIC secrecy in the population. The government must clearly communicate the rationale and implications of the new regulation, ensuring a smooth transition and alleviating public concerns.**Side Notes**1. *Government communication :* The government's communication on this issue has been piecemeal and incoherent, leaving many wondering about the details particularly the intention of this new move.2. *Inter-agency coordination:* The lack of coordination between government agencies, as evident in the ACRA incident, highlights the need for improved communication and alignment.",0.00737590494155882,neutral,-0.17294302062988282,negative

Isn't it like unsecured collateral?|The following is an excellent link to what a Private Lease Scheme (PLS) is:[ Singapore, there are some properties, while technically do not use the term PLS, do feel like one. For example, The Shore developed by Far East in Marine Parade, sits on freehold land. However, it was marketed as 103 years leasehold property. While people salivate at the extra 4 ""free"" years leasehold compared to a typical 99 years leasehold property, few would know what they they are getting into....Unless seller or agent volunteer such information. Most of the time, I seriously doubt so.... Leaseholder do get full ownerships rights during the tenure, and I think developer couldn't care less who the existing owners rent or sell it to during the duration.Ultimately, at the end of the lease, the land ownership reverts to the developer instead of back to the State. People may think this is trivial, but issues may creep up. Imagine, in later years, if land prices skyrocket, the owners may want to cash in on a potential enbloc windfall. Who do you think you need to get permission from, the Strata Titles Board or the developer? And if you are the landowner sitting on an established goldmine, why would you need to share you hoard?I don't think most people would feel good knowing they are buying leasehold properties sitting on freehold land. But sometimes there could be good reasons, lower selling price for buyers and better financials on balance sheet of developer so that its win-win.In the case of a PLS, rightfully it would be to explain as paying an upfront 99 years rent (or at whatever number of years determined). I think the term Long Term Rental Scheme would be more appropriate! Seriously, no one in their right mind would do enter into one, unless, it is cheap....as in DIRT CHEAP!!! Heck, one may not even live to see tomorrow when going to bed tonight, so who in their right mind would rent for a century? And there is also the concept of time-value of money which I shall not get into....As in private treaty, one is free to draft any terms and conditions to your wish, and so long as buyers/sellers are aware and in agreement, it's perfectly fine. There are unique situation when such treaties are negotiated and entered into....Look back into history and think of the Opium War which Hong Kong was ceded to Britain for a 99 years lease for eg.In any case, if I buy freehold I expect to get freehold. If I buy leasehold, I expect leasehold. And if I really want to rent, I rent but definitely not for 99 years! This is an interesting development to follow and see what the Court says and whether it is a case of errant developers or property agents trying to hoodwink unsophisticated buyers! Besides, Iskandar Residences, there is also Afiniti Residences which was sold on PLS which Temasek Holdings have a 50/50 share.....So, the real problem is how developers conduct their business and whether its in good faith, and not the country. Who knows, there are powerful stakeholders out there, such as investment funds, trying to talk down the market and grab some of the goodies pennies on the dollar before dumping in the next high? This happen in the stock market all the time....Malaysia is a great country with plenty of resources and potential if they get their acts right, there's no reason why money cannot be made. You simply need the right reasons, right timing, and the perfect location location location of course!|Out of curiousity, I tried to find the marketing materials for Iskandar Residences online and surprising, it's still online!

t3_1ho0vvl,Need advice on contesting Non-Accidental Injury assessment by doctors,"Dear Reddit,I am a Singaporean parent of 2 children and am desperate for some help or advice.My younger child (1 year old) fell down and injured her right arm. When we went to the hospital, the doctor classified it as a non-accidental injury (NAI), filed a police report against me and my spouse. We are feeling so shocked and frustrated because the hospitals treated us like child abusers without listening to our explanations and refused to discharge us until we signed documents to acknowledge that we caused a non-accidental injury. Because we were so tired, we just signed those documents to go home to sleep, and now we are regretting it.The injury was definitely not caused by us, and we think that it was instead caused by other doctors. I wanted to share our (long) story here to see if anyone has any medical or non-medical advice, perspectives or experiences to share.The background is that my family (me, my spouse, older child, younger child) went for holiday. On the flight, my younger child fell from the airplane seat. We didnt think much about it until 2 hrs later, when we realised that her arm was limp and she could not use it. We called for on-board medical assistance, and thankfully a pediatrician was on board. The pediatrician assessed the arm and the preliminary assessment was a dislocated elbow. She performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place but it did not seem successful. So the pediatrician suggested we go to a hospital immediately upon landing.The airline was kind and arranged for an emergency ambulance to pick us up from the airplane and go straight to the hospital. At the hospital, an x-ray was taken and the doctor said that there was no fracture so it should be a dislocated or pulled elbow and performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place. After the maneuver, the doctors took another x-ray to check that the elbow was fixed, and put her arm in a cast. We continued our holiday for 7 days, growing more and more worried as my child did not regain the usage of her hand.After flying back to Singapore, we immediately went to a hospital A&E to seek a second opinion and assess whether the injury was wrongly diagnosed in the foreign country. The A&E doctor took an x-ray and performed a closed reduction maneuver three times. However this was not successful, so it was referred to Orthopaedics. After waiting for a long while, the Orthopaedic doctor came by and asked many questions about how the injury came about. We had to take time to explain the whole background above while my child was still crying, and so we asked the doctor for his diagnosis and for treatment to be administered quickly as my child was in pain. The Orthopaedic doctor said that it could be a serious injury and that surgery under GA was needed. We were very surprised and initially did not want to agree to GA because our child is only one year old and there were risks. This doctor explained that this is the only way to fix the arm and if surgery is not done as soon as possible, there is risk of permanent deformation of the arm. As parents, when you hear an explanation like that, of course we agreed to the surgery.After the surgery, the doctors said that the operation went well and my child was warded for observation. While warded, we kept asking for details of the injury and a timeline for discharge but no one could give us a clear answer. Two days after the surgery, we received a call from the police saying that a police report had been made against us for non-accidental injury of our child and they needed to investigate because our account was inconsistent with the injury. I felt that this was ridiculous because the doctors had not even explained what injury my child had. After multiple requests for the medical report, the doctors finally told us that the injury was a right distal humerus physeal separation fracture.The doctors explained that it is impossible for such an injury to happen from a fall, as it would require such force if we were to swing our child from the arms. We explained that we definitely did not do such actions, and to us, it seemed more likely that the multiple doctors (on board the plane, the doctor in the foreign country, the A&E doctor) would have caused the fracture. The doctors dismissed our explanations, and insisted that they cannot discharge us until the investigations were complete.To make things worse, they required one parent to be with the child at all times, but refused to allow my older child into the ward. Hence, our family lived apart for five days which was the longest we had ever been separated. On the fifth day after the surgery, two documents (voluntary care agreement and safety plan) were presented to us stating that we as parents could have caused the non-accidental injury. The doctors said that we can be discharged if we sign the two documents, so of course we agreed to go home to see our kids, unpack from our overseas trip and rest properly in a bed.I used to believe that if youve done nothing wrong, youve got nothing to fear. However, after this incident, I realised that even in Singapore, if youve done nothing wrong, you do have something to fear. After going home and resting, we regretted signing those documents. We love our children so much and would never hurt them, but now we admitted guilt of injuring our child in a non-accidental manner. The doctors can still accuse you and confine you in a hospital ward until you sign a confession.Is it there any way for us to contest the doctors assessment that it was a non-accidental injury in Singapore?

While many might think, Of course, I want to know if I have cancer, we need to consider the implications: unnecessary spending on diagnostics, treatments, side effects, and the anxiety that comes with overdiagnosis.Every diagnostic tool has its limitations, including sensitivity and specificity. As a society, we must collectively trust and pressure our medical community to make evidence-based decisions about where to draw the line in detecting and treating such conditions.In a highly litigious society where doctors are frequently sued, the incentive is to overdiagnose and overtreat. A tiny, possibly insignificant Stage 0 breast or prostate lesion? It could lead to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The result? The cancer mortality rate in such a society might appear impressively low, but thats because even non-clinically significant conditions are flagged as cancer. The sheer number of cancer diagnoses increases, but the deaths relative to those diagnoses drop.On the flip side, imagine a more laid-back society where both patients and doctors adopt a hands-off approach. Diagnosis only occurs when someone is already critically ill. In this scenario, the mortality rate appears nearly 100% because cancers are only identified at late stages.Neither of these extremes is ideal. Striking a balance is essential, and we should place our trust in expert communities to make evidence-based decisions about where to draw this line.Source: Biomedical Stats Minor|Why is it always next GEWhat will voting against the govt do for this?

Whether that has produced the desired result is a different matter though lol.It actually feels like there's something to look forward to every month when I lived there.|I don't see why they can't bring back Thaipusam. They could very easily spin it as 'making things fair' to our Indian community, which currently only has one holiday while the other races have two each (three if you consider Vesak Day to be Chinese.)|Think they need to add Thaipusam first before adding another non religious PH cos I recall they were imbalanced vs other races|Yet Thaipusam was taken off the list of PH.|PH is ph, Im not bothered which race's holiday as long as every race gets to take the ph.|I propose a holiday to be called ""racial/religious harmony day"" to avoid said racial/religious unbalance. This holiday will fall on one Friday (or Monday) in September, so we will have one more long weekend, and add one holiday to second half of the year. Because usually first half will have 8 holidays and 3 for send half. Actually another way is to make Children's Day (first Friday of October) a PH. Not only children don't have to go to school, let sec/poly/jc also, and parents no work don't have to worry how to take care of children, we can really spend some meaningful time (hopefully) with our loved ones.

So far they only have 1 day.|Youve mastered the technique they use to scam us perfectly. If i give this to you, i have to give this to everyone else; since when is singapore so generous. Sg is no utopia, no such thing as perfect equality, they need to at least try instead of making such excuses|I think Singapore has one of, if not the lowest amount of holidays globally.

We're all equal..|Australia has a minimum 20 days annual leave but most people don't receive bonuses, most companies in Singapore award at least 1 month of wage supplement which makes up for the lower annual leave. Take 6 more days of unpaid leave and pay yourself out of your bonus and you'll still be ahead.Not to mention many companies have a mandatory 2 week shut down period around the Christmas holidays (the most expensive time to travel) which gets taken out of your annual leave leaving you with up to 14 days to take on your own time.|Most companies in Aus practice Christmas-NYE shutdown period. They deduct from your annual leave so you have 5-7 days gone.I had to negotiate to allow me to stay at work so I can fly back to SG for CNY.|12 is pretty accurate though. I think you're also including ""cuti bersama"" which is not government mandated (if you work in the private sector your employer could choose not to grant you). E.g. the actual PH for eid are just 2 days, the rest is ""cuti bersama"". The actual PH is closer to 12-13, could be less if some of it falls on weekends.I think your second paragraph is PTO, which is a separate matter.|Its not as sunshine as rainbows, there are extra holidays which are deducted from your PTO. Its bad because that means you are forced to take holiday when its both crowded and most expensive. Just for example, in 2025 there will be 17 PH and 10 extra holidays, standard PTO for a typical white collar worker is 12 so that means you just have 2 days for your own. For these extra holidays practically there are 3 possibilities depending on employers :1. Forced to take the holiday, deduct from PTO.2. You can still work, dont deduct PTO3. Just go and enjoy holiday.And obviously 1 is super majority.Also small side note that there is no mandate to honor public holidays (in SG, if it falls on Sunday, monday will be a PH) that falls during weekends. So 17 is the PH but the practical number is usually closer to 14-15Many employers though also give a few days extra for hari raya (mostly because traffic is disastrous and many people travel by car for hari raya). That being said not everyone enjoys the PH rights the same in Indonesia. Labour laws only practically applies only to white collar workers or big manufacturing which are minority of the total workforce. There are religious discriminations like Christian employees getting less holiday (only get exactly as government mandated, or worse still expected to cover for their colleagues without holiday pay) during hari raya with the justification that they arent celebrating.|There were 16 gazetted holidays at federal level in 2024. However mandatory holidays at federal level are only 3. States have their own and the number of state level holidays employers have to give is typically between 8-14. So the total holidays that employers need to give is between 11-17. However enforcement of workplace laws greatly varies (mostly to the detriment of the employees) so actual holidays enjoyed varies a lot.|To add on, I had the chance to glance at India PH calendar recently. Seems like different regions choose different PH as off days|Does 31 days include or exclude public holidays? Our leave entitlements are 11 public holidays on top of individual paid leave which on average around 14-18 days.Also how many % pay is the parental leave?|To clarify, they have 6 public holidays in Vietnam, but some holidays are given different days off instead of 1.Like for Tet, they are given 5 days off and their National Day, they are given 2 days off. So in total, they have **11 days of break from their 6 public holidays**.|So, in the context of the conversation, he meant has about 30 days of paid vacation days.

It's just a frank reply on why things are they way they are.If people are not happy, can go ballot polls to try.|> They get 3 days after 6 months, 7 days after a year, and 10 days after 2 years. After 3 years they get 14 days, and after 5 years they get 15 days. For every year after 10 years that an employee spends in a role, they get 1 extra day of paid annual leave, up to a maximum of 30 days a year.These are just mandated minimums though. Singapore's mandated minimums are much worse than this. Apart from the 3 days after 6 months, Taiwan's progression is the same as Singapore's, but Singapore's is capped at 14 days, whereas Taiwan's goes up to 30 days.|Malaysians only get 2 PH for the kings. 1 for the Agong and 1 for the state they are in. They don't get 1 for each Sultan. That would be nuts|>one PH for each king(depends on which state)This is just wrong. If you are in Johor, you only observe Johor Sultan's day, the other states' one are non of your business.|But companies only need to recognise 11 holidays and only 4 to 5 of them are mandatory. Usually companies will recognise major cultural and religious festivals like Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Hari Raya Haji, CNY, Deepavali and Christmas. My ex-company didn't have a lot of Malay staff, so it didn't recognise things like Awal Muharram and Prophet Muhammad's birthday. Some companies can choose to give Wesak and Thaipusam off or not, depending on the boss.| seems you are right. Singapore has 11 -same as France. But definitely in the lower part of the ranking|Otot I've never joined a co that has 7 days annual leave.

Thaipusam didn't cross my mind when I write my comment|they can just say vesak is an indian holiday although most indians dont celebrate it now.|Agreed and I suppose most people have the same perspective, but I would say the gov probably prefer taking a neutral PH to avoid being accused of giving any group a racial privilege|Childrens day should be a Ph for those who have kids.

I get pushback from people. But if I ever decide to run for parliament (or people similar to me), my argument would be: I did this and succeeded, yeah grinding sucks but you have to do so if you want to get somewhere ; lets make it a policy..and watch the pushback.In fact, a rich person who doesnt have to grind might even be conned into thinking oh no thats so much work let me suggest policies that reduce the work you do or oh no saving 20% of income per month seems too high and not allowing you to take out till 63 means you cannot enjoy life like me, lets change it|Singaporeans, please dont vote for PV or Prabu this coming election.

Surely the majority here do not view LKY in a negative light isn't it? And isn't true that SGreans feel that PAP deserve to have a super majority in the parliament as they hail from prestigious JC/unis and were graduates from Ivy leagues school or the likes of Oxbridge, LSE, and that such strong ""A-Team"" is need to enable SG to survive?

Chinua Achebe's books about British Colonialism were huge in shaping post-colonial attitudes in Africa. That isn't even considering things like The Diary of Anne Frank and The Gulag Archipelago that solidified anti-USSR sentiment during the Cold War.Hell, even a large part of the denouncement of Nazism was from literature depicting the Holocaust. Without the huge exposure from Literature, the Holocaust would not be so well known.For examples closer to Asian roots, you have the Analects which ARE literature, the Journey to the West made Buddhism more accessible to the masses then and as a negative example, Mao's Little Red Book is also an example of literature that influenced the world.|it helps bring in diverse voices? people constantly complain about sg being run like a company, over-focusing purely on numbers and money tends to do that|[deleted]|If nothing else, they're usually good at attracting support.

You do not have to like reading the books. You have to understand how it changed people's thinking or raised their awareness to the point where they will protest or lobby for something to change.Eng Lit does more for that than any Economics or Public Policy degree, because the rest are NOT about changing people's attitudes.|Parliament is the peoples chamber, its supposed to raise and formulate policies for everyone in Singapore, regardless of social status/education/work background. You want as much diverse views of the people in that chamber.Having a lot of policy wonks would mean that Parliament would just pass laws that are theoretically good but might not be what the people like. For instance, banning pets in homes is technically a good policy from a governance standpoint, but do people want that? Raising CPF age is a good idea from a governance POV (less social issues), but would the public like that kind of policy?Those people good in policy and governance should be in Civil Service, not Parliament.

To provide the technical depth behind the direction and discussions of parliament? Parliament discusses the problems they see everyday, the government goes back to do deeper analysis and provide relevant solutions. The problem our parliament faced in the past was their inability to appreciate the repercussions from their policies which is why WP is ascendant. But, putting this candidate aside what I disagree about this discussion is that somehow the subreddit wants singapore to transcend paper degrees but at the same time judges a person by something studied probably decades ago. Given how fast knowledge advances, our degrees are already obsolete in five years or so and that is when our experience and area of practice take precedence. Like if someone came up for election on the basis that he was a computing grad from the 1990s but he had spent the last 30 years doing social work. Would the computing degree have any impact on our decision?|[deleted]|Cabinet makes policy with the public servants. There are plenty of policies and regulations that start from the civil service and are supported by cabinet and parliament. MPs provide their views and challenges. For the MPs that lack policy experience, there are aides, briefings and other party support if you need to get relevant legislative/policy knowledge. Unless you are an almost independent candidate like chiam see tong in the past. On the discussion, we were talking about your view that degrees needed to be relevant. Glad to see you agree that they dont have to be. The question now is, putting her aside, why running a business in a country where hundreds of thousands of us are self employed and/or in f&b is irrelevant for politics. I don't agree with her candidacy on many aspects including a lack of track record in the community/social/union space (I believe it is an important criteria whether she really hears the people), but disagree on principle that politicians must have qualifications or experience that is specific to policy making and legislation to be elected. That leaves us with a very tiny pool of talent. This is especially at a time when we are trying to find the correct balance to steer our country forward while making sure valid voices are heard. However if these mps want to be effective and continue to have our vote, they will still have to show us through their performance in the community and parliament. And if policy awareness and making is a criteria that the people hold paramount, then they shouldn't continue to receive support.","Peoples Voices Prabu Ramachandran Looks Down on NUS English Literature Students, Says is Worthless - In response to PAPs New Candidates Education Background nan",-0.7037574030876159,negative,0.01268909211158753,neutral

A lot of things you mentioned have nothing to do with passports. A passport is simply a travel document. Your mobility comes as a result of your citizenship, not because of your passport, which itself derives its 'power' from your citizenship.The ability to move around a large country is because the country is... large, not because that country's passport allows it. You don't need a passport to move within a country.The citizens of Schengen states do not need passports to move within the Schengen Area. That right is granted as a result of citizenship, which can be proven with national ID cards. The right does not come because of their passport.|I think what you are highlighting, is size. Singapore is small. Tiny. We don't have multiple cities like Malaysia where one can work in Johor for 10 years then move to Kelantan for the next 10.

Others have committed on the fact that your complaint is about Singapores size. No passport is designed to give you residency status, only ease of travel. You are blaming a fish for being bad at climbing a tree. Even then, accounting for your preferred focus on migration and long term residency, the power of this passport is such that it is easy for us to get extended stays in other nations, allowing us to get academic credentials, cultural exposure and even do job searches in other nations. With a much weaker passport, I can tell you from experience that globe hopping for jobs and stays will be much harder.Case in point, you were able to move to the UK much easier compared to someone with similar skill levels from another southeast asian nation.|You're right about the strength of the Singapore passport, and you're right about limited mobility.However, those two things are not connected at all.|Dont say overseas bro, even within Singapore mobility is also limited.

With a passport, there are 2 main benefits: 1) Visa free travel and 2) Mobility free travel. The #1 ranking focuses on visa free travel, which is great for holidays and spontaneous work trips compared to a Chinese or Indonesian counterpart. What OP should have done is to negate the argument on land size and migration within inter-country - that has nothing to do with land size. So right intention but wrong execution argument wise. What Singapores passport lacks is 2) Mobility free travel. We only have 1-2 countries to do working holiday visas with, and in comparison to countries like UK, Japan, South Korea etc which are similar to us in visa free travel rankings, they definitely enjoy much more mobility free travel. Strong EU passports definitely benefit the most in this case, but I think thats where the Singapore passport really fails despite all its efforts to be marketed as #1.|I want what this guy is smoking.|Every thing that you said is correct, and in fact, I believe [Nomad Capitalists passport ranking]( (where Singapore ranks at 24th tied with say Romania and Cyprus) is a far more accurate measure of freedom of mobility and access to opportunities than simply counting the number of countries you can travel as a tourist visa-free.But remember that despite all of that, every year 10 thousand Malaysians renounce their citizenships to get the Singaporean citizenship. I agree that passport strength is overrated, but this is not the only thing that citizenship entails.|This comes across as kind of a strange lament. The comparisons are with economic powerhouses, rather than with similar populations or land mass. Even more curiously, with the whole of the EU, a collaborative body of nations. We dont get the same kind of mobility Id argue we do have mobility nonetheless; clearly, at least one of us moved to the UK. And the intentions behind the comparison is also vague; the ability to move within the borders of a single nation so as to leverage opportunities is by no means a solid indicator of personal or professional success, though it can have a positive effect. And what does that have to do with passport rankings? By its own logic, intercity movement requires no passport, and while one might live and work across different nations in the EU, this is again a misdirection; it has more to do with the willingness for those nations to collaborate than the relative strength of their passports.|Ya SG sucks if you like to move around.

It just adds a lot of unpredictability and hassle.|Your truly average person only travels maybe once every 3-4 years, and they can only afford to go to nearby countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. I also know of people who did not have a passport until they were in their 30s because they simply never had the money to travel. Traveling is a privilege. If you can afford to travel even once a year, you are already way above the average person.

The number of countries you can enter, and the ease of doing so, is a direct parameter to measure the value for a passport, bar none. On this parameter, the Singapore passport Is objectively the strongest one in the world. All this talk about an EU citizen being able to work in other EU states, and Americans being able to work in all 50 states, has nothing to do with the passport strengths of their respective citizens. You can argue it as a perk of their citizenship over Singapore citizenship instead, but it has nothing to do with passports. In fact, if you want to argue about the benefits of other countries' citizenship, there will always be pros and cons in all areas. You want to live in the EU? Well have fun with 50% income tax.

Passport is only used for international travel and not relevant to the discussion about domestic freedom of movement. Also, all the hoops we have to jump through to go overseas are from singaporean bureaucracy that is relatively easier compare to applying for a visa with a foreign country. Just a quick search online reveals how incredibly difficult it is for students in say, the Philippines, to get Schengen visas just to study in Europe. It can be up to 20-30 documents that you need to do so. Conversely Singaporeans just have to declare to the appropriate authorities / get exit permit and you are free to travel.

Might as well say UK passport better cuz their weather not as hot?|your examples dont make sense. big countries have many places to move to. what does that have to do with passport?The EU Schengen Zone is a political thing where its members agree to let its citizens move internally to live and work without restrictions. ASEAN could theoretically do the same thing but of cos that would never happen. again nothing to do with passport|I think you misunderstand the fundamental purpose of a passport, which is used expressly for international travel. All your examples of mobility within a particular country is wholly irrelevant.Your entire rant has nothing to do with a passport, it is simply about the limitation of opportunities that comes with being a citizen of a small city-state, which is largely homogeneous in culture. The proper way to determine the power of a Singaporean passport is whether it grants greater or lesser access to international travel. And by that metric, the Singapore passport outstrips most others.|best passport is in terms of visa free travel for citizens holding the passport. Not best of the interests of citizens to travel freely and expand their horizon.|Honestly I wouldnt give up my Singapore passport for anything else. It has proven to me, time and again, that I can get my applications for whatever/wherever faster than anyone else that I know (who are of different nationalities).|That is just the consequence of being born on a small island nation. How about quit whining and immigrating to another country if you love big spaces so much?|You super underestimated the power of SG passport I qualified for no-lottery special H1B1 SG/Chilean national only visa and the application process is as straightforward as being Canadian I could transit through many/most countries without needing to apply for a visa Having a less suspicious passport also meant less questioning.I was riding Amtrak to Canada and watched a Chinese national get questioned thoroughly by the walk aboard border officers about her itineraryI quickly jotted down notes of my own travel plans in readiness and was ready or even eager to regale the officers with my plans but sadly they took one look at my red passport and just said Welcome to Canada!|Passport is for traveling overseas, nothing else. For work opportunities the better measure is employment rate. A larger country or a large economic bloc also mean a larger number of job seekers. Despite our size Id argue its far easier for an average Singaporean to find a job in Singapore than its for a johorean to find a job in Malaysia. Heck there are probably more johoreans working in Singapore than in KL. Same for the average European. If ease of travel within eu means there are more work opportunities, there wont be different employment rates among eu countries.For retirement the average Singaporean can choose to retire in jb batam Bangkok or even Laos Cambodia. Not on account of our passport but on the back of our strong sgd, cpf and HDB.|I have an Indian passport and I dont think you realise the power of your passport. The other day I was having a conversation with my Singapore friend and he was talking about having a vacation in Europe. He hadnt yet decided but the trip is probably in a month. Im jealous that he can have that situation as I need to prepare a huge set of documents for visa in advance. I dont think a lot of countries can afford to be unplanned for a vacation to another country.|This is such a privileged, first world complaint.|This post doesn't makes sense. Yes you raise some valid issues but we are locked geographically so it isn't the issue with the passport. Asean could do the same thing as the EU but we are a long way from achieving that to enjoy ease of moving to a different country.At the very least, we don't need to do those visa applications when visiting which can take lots of time and money.|Dude just discovered sg doesnt have a hinterland.|Freedom to move within country is not the same as freedom to move around the world; you need a citizenship to be in one country and a passport to move across countries. Your concern is more around the physical size of Singapore more so than the passport itself. I'd suggest you edit your post for clarity.|As a foreigner, I fucking hate it when I see a Singaporean not realising how privileged they are. Maybe the first step to make you entitled to complain is to forgo your Singaporean nationality and adopt one from a bigger country instead? Try India or China maybe|Your complaint is that people can move around freely WITHIN their own country but Singaporeans cannot move into another country. That's a ridiculous comparison.Your issue has nothing to do with passport ""strength"" and only has to do with the size and diversity of a country.In your example that a Malaysian can choose to live/work in KL or Johor, that Malaysian is not even using his passport so there's nothing to compare against the Singapore passport.You can complain that there's no laid back area to go to in Singapore for people who rather not chiong the rest race. That's a completely fair point. But it has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with how strong or weak the Singapore passport is.|This is not Singapore passport's limitation, it's the size of the city state. When we talk about passport we are talking about crossing border.|Now on a business trip in Europe. Every bloke before me thats non EU passport, gets questioned. Oh, i used the EU & citizen fast lane when clearing London Stansted. it's not about the Singapore passport, which is respected, it just that we are tiny city state. unless we have muscle for a Xinjinping or Putin landgrab, i can live with the fact that travelling within Singapore is boring. i can lived with that.|By your comment, you do not understand what a passport is forA passport is simply a travel document, you should not mix it up with citizenship, you can simply give up your Singaporean citizenship if you desire to be the citizen of another country (presuming you pass all of their requirements)|i read until you compared to msia. lol feel free to hop on over mate|the passport ranking is exactly that, a ranking of passports. The purpose of a passport is just that, short term travel. and nothing else.You are misled thinking it is a ranking of citizenship, or of mobility even.Holding a passport of X country has symbolic value of what it means to be a citizen, but symbolic being the keyword here. it is not the same thing.>The amount of barriers I had to jump through to get out of Singapore was really another level.I absolutely disagree here. being singaporean gives you very good mobility to go overseas. a ton of singaporeans work or live overseas.1. strong singapore currency for good exchange rates2. high base level of education3. good international reputation4. proximity to malaysia, if you so desire to retire there.5. bilingualI would like to know what sort of barriers you were facing that were caused by being singaporean.and for accuracy, try to imagine a scenario where you were the citizen of another country, would you still have faced these barriers?|Congrats on your move to uk. Thank you for enlightening us. That's your point of wot isn't it?|This rankings you see everywhere glorifying the strongest passports are very miss leading. It's only about visa free travel.If it is about living and working EU passports are far ahead, like ridiculously far.Nothing compares to visa free living and working in 27 countries|> A citizen of a larger country like the US, China, Australia, hell even our neighbour Malaysia has opportunity to move, study, work and live in different cities and towns but within the same country. For us we can only use it for travel or short business trips, which majority of Singaporeans don't utilise anyway.I'm not sure you understand what a passport actually does. When people talk about the strength of a passport they're talking about the relative ease/difficulty of a citizen from country X entering another country, due to existing recognition/reputation/bilateral ties.A passport's strength has absolutely zero bearing on the size of landmass that the country happens to be on. One does not need a passport to go to another city within the same country. Just like you don't need a passport to go from Changi to Jurong.|Don't whack the passport till you see what hoops people with ' lesser ' passports have to jump through - just for a random trip to certain countries.Singapore is a small city state.

Singapore is small and dense.|...?What's OP going on about? What does any of that have anything to do with passport strength?|There are silent advantages, many of my colleagues here in the US had a much harder time than me with the visa and green card processes, and this is echoed my my singaporean friends.In addition, in the US, we have the special H1B1 visa for work, and we can work for short periods in the schengen area. Just because you didn't get preferential treatment in the UK doesn't mean this is uniformly true internationally.|You have enough earning power to finance a new start in a new country if you're educated.And your country has many local companies with strong operational presence across many countries.So - although you have a strong passport from an access point if view and your country is small which leaves little room for domestic mobility - you are still in a better position than 80%-90% of countries ito international mobility.|The Singaporean passport is great. You get to travel visa free to most countries, plus theres a special H1B1 visa for moving to the States (which only Singaporean and Chilean citizens are eligible for). I get your drift, but it seems more to do with how small Singapore is (being a city state) rather than anything to do with the passport which is objectively awesome!|As someone who used to have a weaker passport, having the ability to travel to many places is really a privilege.

Valid points that require pondering, but not really about the passport itself. More about the lottery of being born in the ""wrong"" country? Then again, as many have pointed out, most would rather be born Singaporean than of some other nationality. And at least it's better than being born in some other small island states in the Caribbean or Pacific...|Luck of the draw as you rightly put it. Safest and most stable country in the world but also one of the smallest and most boring. Tbh I never saw that much of a disadvantage after you discount for citizens/locals of a country. If you really wanted to migrate anywhere, the resources on hand in singapore really give us an edge. We mostly can speak and write English at a high level, have solid numeracy skills, etc. That shines versus many other economic migrants I've had to screen for various roles internationally. Unfortunately working/living overseas really requires you to put in effort to achieve still and there are good lessons to learn from many of the less prosperous countries that rely on this route for survival.

Who wants to work there when taxes are stupidly high? Even if you think you are above ""average"" you are going to scrape through, the same even in Japan.You make it sound like Singapore passport only benefits the upper echelon and that the regular Joe isn't going to cut it.Fair I have friends that stick through the typical Singapore life of study, work, marry and only go Thailand.But Singapore passport beats the crap outta every single passport out there for the regular Joe or not.|So imagine if our passport wasnt so good.

And I do agree with you, having lived here for most of my life. I do see it though as people who don't want change and are happy being in the same place for their whole lives. The one good thing about Singapore that said, is that one is much more in touch with the rest of the world because of the use of English, especially when it comes education or opportunities at MNCs to relocate overseas. In a sense it's a double edge sword when it comes to mobility.|The other side of the coin is that Singapore is supposed to be a great place to live and work so that you don't want to move overseas. For most people, especially outside of the Reddit echo chamber, this is very true. People in other countries are more driven to move for better opportunities, but Singaporeans tend to get caught up with living near their parents and that's the end of that because life is pretty decent here.We also have the most useful and important mobility tool that only one other country has: The H1B1 visa.

If you cant change it, why keep focusing on it?As for the passport and diplomatic relations, sure, theyre a benefit, but in reality, its not what ultimately defines your ability to emigrate or pursue opportunities abroad.

Others like yourself, move to even better places like London.The average SG person can move to another place sure - but it will cost more in terms of opportunity cost, and others. So your point is kinda moot. If a person really wants, they can always take the option to go elsewhere - whether they can do it or not, or if it makes sense or not is another problem.In my experience, SG identity/passport is a great mobility tool.

In this particular issue I think it is very dangerous to make deals with obscure and unstable countries just for the sake of having a +1 in the passport and continue fighting the race to the top. Specially because Singapore is a very small country. I think prioritizing security is more important and instead Singapore should have secured free traveling only to countries with some real interest, either for business or pleasure.But the issues the OP described don't really have much to do with the passport and more with Singapore's size and the lack of free movement agreements, which can be done only in areas that are stable and homogeneous.|Yknow theres a lot of people who would gladly get your passport without a second thought. Great for in border mobility but whats the use when their living expenses are out of control?

You are talking about people in Malaysia moving to kl to work. Yes, they can move from state to state - now think about why they need to do that? Is it because there are less jobs which pay less where they originally live in? In Singapore, you dont have to move anywhere and you can find decent jobs. Most of the people in eu who move to a different country to work are moving from a lower economic zone to a higher one - people from east Europe for example moving to west Europe- France, Germany, Spain, etc. because the jobs pay better. Do you know that it is ridiculously easy for Singaporeans to get long term visit / student / work visas in almost any country?

Visa gets approved faster, your credentials are almost never doubted. Our words are trusted. That is important in business and deal making. Especially when were dealing with authorities. And there are other interesting perks if one dont fit the stay in Singapore mould. Wanna work in China? Not too difficult for us. US? We have H1B1, which has never been totally filled. ASEAN? Not too difficult. Lets also not forget that because were neutral in a way, both the Chinese and Americans leave us alone, which is great. The SG government does not make a great show of we will get you back if you have a SIN passport unlike China, but from COVID it shows we actually try fairly hard to give our citizens a great chance or returning home, even when it involves flying them from China.|Yeah I'm quite suaku. Not so much about the UK specifically it just so happened to be where I am, more about my work environment where majority of my colleagues are international migrants like myself and they shared their stories.|OPs next realisation will probably be that the power of the passport is limited by the wealth of the bearer.

But with our passport and reputation, it helps us get things through easier such as through passport control. I have a non-sg friend who has a weak passport and she was asked tons of questions when she was travelling to Germany where she is living whereas for most singaporeans (myself and others i have met) it is a breeze. of course there are some countries with strong ties like japan has some ties with Germany so some japanese can enter germany/ EU a bit freely but thats more on diplomatic ties. Also people in syria could move to germany easier than singaporeans but it doesnt mean they have a strong passport. Ultimately, imo most Singaporeans are free to move elsewhere but many dont for different reasons and theres no right / wrong answer to that. In terms of mobility, i dont think its in anyway not beneficial for us with a Singaporean passport, but rather ones choice.|I think the implication is that passport = citizenship. Youre kind of being pedantic here.|This is a bit pedantic you can assume OP meant citizenship, as the passport is a document that proves your citizenship for travel|On the other hand, this is an observation made by my Filipino colleuage, Singaporeans have the good fortune to always be able to find work in their own hometown and leaving is a choice not a necessity.|Size? Try Malta for size.|i think OP is conflating the 'power' rankings for many other things. if i'm not wrong, these rankings are purely about leisure travel, so talking about geography, and whether someone decides to work in the middle east before moving to europe is entirely a different matter imo.|Exactly. The OP has legitimate greviences about SG: small, less diverse economic opportunities, hard to fit in a single mold.But linking it back to the passport specifically is super odd lol. No one is saying that having a ""powerful"" passport overcomes all those aforementioned limitations. If anything, our ability to travel allows us to alleviate those concerns much better. If you are someone who has to make many short work trips, you'd appreciate things much more.Is it better to be an American or European than hold our red passport? That's for you to decide, and spans many other dimensions. Holding a passport implies citizenship, which is much more than just travel.

Per capita the numbers are similar, with singapore having a slighlty higher renunciation rate.|If you look closely, Singaporean passport lost on 4 indexs1. Dual citizenship : 10/50 yup. We are in the same ballpark as North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan. Oh Iraq gets 30/502. Freedom : 30/50 we have no freedom. Countries higher than us are like New Zealand, Namibia, Suraname, Norway, Finland. USA has 30 like us.Countries with max score includes Palau, Tuvalu, Samoa. In other words, not sure how they calculate this score3. Perception : 40/50 People perception of us is worse than Iceland, Ireland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Austria, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, South Korea.4. Travel : 174/179 yes they rank us way below top despite us having top visa free access.

Not unexpected though from someone whose default argument goes back to the old tired argument of attacking other countries.Did any part of my post say EU is a better place to live? Did I bring up anything about the IRS or the USA? But yet your first reaction is ""uhhh insult Singapore, everywhere else is worse"". The crux of the observation is this. Singapore is small, and our passport limits us to just living and working in Singapore. When we talk about our passport being strong number one and being the most desirable, it does not matter to most of us who don't benefit from it and does not factor in everything. The ranking is flawed. Try asking someone from the third world if he/she rather take an EU passport or a Singapore passport if can only pick one.|It has more to do with the current way in which ranking is defined. I think op is mixing up citizenship and passport strength although I understand where op is coming from. Our passport is ranked number one but above all 190+ countries but yet we can only use it to move from Hougang to Jurong.

It is easier for Singaporeans to be approved for a variety of visas, I dont doubt this. Even better for visit visas which dont require applications beforehand. But in terms of mobility type visas like working holiday or youth mobility visas, or maybe getting an edge to work in a certain country (with the exception of the US), Singapore is just the same as everywhere else like Malaysia etc. So on that basis, UK or Canada would be higher ranking than Singapore for example.|Woodlands might be slower.

H1B1 is the only exception I can think of in the US, but thats where being Singaporean is negligible to lets say a Malaysian in terms of foreign recognition and benefit.|Yes, but the overwhelming majority of the 1,400 Singaporeans arent renouncing Singaporean citizenship for Malaysian citizenship (I addressed Malaysia specifically because it was the country mentioned by OP).Comparing the perceived value of Singapore citizenship with other developed countries is a more complex matter. From my observation, Singapore citizenship tends to be more popular among ethnical Asians, due to proximity to their families or the belief that they would be treated as second class citizens in the ang moh countries. Of course, there are also those who simply dont have the opportunity to move to developed countries other than Singapore.|Actually, it is about 5,000 Malaysians per year who renounce their citizenship.  number is closer to 1,500 for Singapore. might of course not like the company who created the ranking, but the criteria are very laid out and objective.The ranking measures freedom of mobility and access to economic opportunities. In the YT video where the guy explains the ranking, he mentions that countries are penalised due to not allowing dual citizenship and having mandatory national service. Which is uh totally correct? No matter how much you think NS is good or necessary, you dont have freedom of mobility and access to economic opportunities when doing NS. Even if you are a woman or new citizen who doesnt need to serve NS, if you have a son bound to serve to NS you are likely discouraged from seeking opportunities abroad.As for travel, the criteria is clearly explained in the website. It doesnt consider only visa free access but it measures all bureaucracy needed for entering a country including electronic authorisations, visa on arrival, etc. As a matter of fact, Singaporeans need to apply for ETIAS when visiting the 30 European countries while Europeans do not. Yes, Singaporens dont need a visa to enter Venezuela while Swiss people do, but between Europe and Venezuela, which place both Singaporeans and Swiss are more likely to visit?|> Travel : 174/179 yes they rank us way below top despite us having top visa free access.We don't have top ""visa free access"".

It doesnt matter if you pitch to say oh you have a SG passport so H1B1 is sure get etc.The only exception is a hyper rare scenario where there are 2 interviewees who make it to the final round of the final interview with similar skillsets and experiences and both are equally liked. And one is a Singaporean whose H1B1 is sure get, and another is an X country citizen who needs to go on the H1B lottery. But if one can get to this stage the visa I would think is the least concern as there are multiple ways around it.|>A Singaporean passport grants its holder the privilege of being considered a Commonwealth citizen, which allows them to travel to and live in other Commonwealth countries with relatively easier access, including the right to vote and hold public office in the United Kingdom, even though Singapore gained independence and is no longer a British territory;.|Precisely.

As a home country, msia is huge with different states that can allow for so much exploration, and at any time you want. Living in a small island SG really gets boring too quickly, seeing the same things everyday, and theres no other states to travel to. Want to see new sights = must travel out of country. Just imagine being stuck to only KL your entire life. Msia KL salaries are competitive too (relative to cost-of-living). Can just buy a house, the land is yours forever for generations, unlike SG where must slave away whole life to afford a shoebox HDB that is LEASED by govt for only 99 years then they take back. And then my children will need to repeat this never-ending suffering cycle again. Same thing for car ownership, every 10 years must pay back to SG govt as if they are loan sharks. Too much more to list.Only gripe about msia is the relative food prices which are more expensive. But if you do the math, msians will still get to save more and hence allow for greater degree of travel etc. Of course, Im not considering the national policies here, where questionable ones like the Bumiputra policy are obviously a clear racial discrimination and deterrence.|Because you are fundamentally not understanding the difference between passport and citizenship. When people compare passports, they are comparing each person's ability to bypass immigration in another country. If you are comparing the benefits of being able to live and work in another country, that is a comparison of CITIZENSHIP. Your entire argument is centering around the benefits of each country's citizenship, which has NOTHING to do with passport strengths. Yes, you can argue that someone from a third world country will desire EU citizenship more than Singapore citizenship due to various reasons, partially because the social safety nets in EU is better than Singapore. But when it comes to passport strengths, Singapore passport will more often than not be better than a EU passport when it comes to bypassing immigration control, because that's what it's meant for.|Nope not having it.

False.|then dont believe me. no skin off my back|You cannot provide the evidence to support your claim because your claim about Singapore citizens having easier access to UK residency is false.You are spreading falsehood and fake news. Someone should POFMA you.","After moving to the UK, I realised that the Singapore passport isn't that great for mobility for the average person and the passport ranking doesn't mean much for most of us Don't get me wrong, for a country of our size and population MFA is doing a fantastic job and we punch well above our weight. I have personally benefitted from the visa free access for some countries where my colleagues/non Singaporean friends had to jump through so many hoops to get through immigration.For the average person, however, a Singapore citizenship and passport does not actually offer that much tangible benefit in terms of day to day mobility and opportunities. A citizen of a larger country like the US, China, Australia, hell even our neighbour Malaysia has opportunity to move, study, work and live in different cities and towns but within the same country. For us we can only use it for travel or short business trips, which majority of Singaporeans don't utilise anyway.The average Johorean can move to KL for work if he/she wants a more fast paced life, and conversely KL back to Johor if he/she wants to relax a bit. A HK citizen can move to the greater bay area for more space and cheaper housing, and conversely back to HK if he/she wants to ""chiong"" and accelerate up the career. A citizen of EU can choose to work in one of the 27 countries if they so choose and pick and choose which culture/economy suits them. As with the US with its 50 states or India with its 28 provinces. For most of us in Singapore, however, we have no such option. Most of us born, study, live, work and die in the same place. We can't choose to work in the city then retire in the hometown, we can't choose to move between towns or cities and when we apply for jobs the same way others can because the only place we can tick yes to working rights is limited to employers on one island Singapore.Tough luck if one does not fit the Singaporean mould. If you have limited education or are single/lgbt then the life that lies ahead is essentially being stuck with one's parents until the government is gracious enough to grant access to a 2 room flat at the age of 35.

The reality for canteen vendors is kids eat so much junk at home that unhealthy food sells better. Otherwise they wont be able to earn. I see my friends kids eating hotdog nugget for breakfast coz its easier to prepare. For canteen vendors to sell healthier food it is hard to earn much and the kids will shun them. Yet if they sell junk food, some school admins will go after them. They are just stuck in a not so good position while chasing very low profit.Then consider how low the price they have to sell the food at, with only a fixed customer base and only certain timing of the weekday they can sell.

It also doesn't account for the fact that the median hawker stall rental is about 125x what a canteen vendors pays. Also, the lower skill required to cook canteen-standard food may not be able sustain a good hawker business in a much more competitive environment outside.Your point is not invalid but your math is hyperbolic.Anyway, I do know a canteen vendor who supplements his stall with a catering business and can afford to drive a Mercedes around, so it's possible to make it work.|Yeah I think so, source is from my memory reading some article in the past haha.|They are just planning to phase out canteen vendors.

But consider also that (a) these vendors are working with a very consistent and extremely predictable customer base (so, easier to plan, less wasted resources) and (b) a literally locked-in / no other choice customer base so if they focus on giving bang for buck (and not minimum for buck), it can actually be quite viable.Any food vendor can get up and go if they arent happy with the setup.

Almost all airline food is prepared in a central kitchens, that includes business and first class meals. Most of the food we consume at fast food eateries, and healthy meal preps are prepared at central kitchens. The complaint about food quality does not stem from the preparation being in a central kitchen We need to understand the goal is to balance food price, nutritional balance, quality and wider access to all school going children. Central kitchen is one of the most feasible ways of achieving this goal. Additionally the current school meal system is totally not sustainable and operators are slowly dying out. To raise pricing will lead to complaints from parents.But to not do anything and not raising pricing will eventually lead to central cookhouses entering the schools anyway as the stalls die out. That is already happening. You can complain all you want about NS kitchens, but were already slowly moving into that reality, where Ns food vendors are also the school food vendors.|INFINITE CHICKEN|This is such a ridiculous strawman argument.

The problem to me is when the potential (not actual) reward from running a stall is so low that you can't even attract legitimate participants. 50 people even if they ate every meal, divided by say 3 to 4 stalls, isn't that much of a sell. Overseas, I've seen office canteens that can barely survive with 300 workers despite being in such an isolated location, they are the only choice.

Lol. Very very lethal. Might as well wear roller skatesThis pic makes me miss my old house alot! Used to live in Joo Chiat for more than 10 years before Covid. Haha|I slipped once at Joo Chiat. These exact coloured tiles lmao.|Absolute trash. They replaced the tiles in my neighbourhood with these slippery nonsense more than a decade ago. Had a few slipping scares. The only weather this country has is rain. And these tiles cannot handle it.|Some of the weird glossy coatings under some HDB blocks are as slippery as this.No idea why they'd make OUTDOOR FLOORING this slippery, instead of having coarse, rough material everywhere so even a worn-out shoe can have proper traction. Especially in our country where more and more people are getting older. Another one is the metal edges for the staircase. Wtf is that? You purposely want people to slip when wet isit?|Eh don't wait for top-down solutions hor, learn to skate with them slippers on.|Worst. I always walk on the road instead. Another killer is the yellow tactile paving at pedestrian crossings once it was raining heavily and I slipped on a freshly painted one. On the opposite end of a road another person also fell almost at the same time. Like comedy sia. Youd think theyd think of anti slip designs with the amount of rain we get!|Make sure your soles have rubber|Haha just scraped half of my leg on this|All it needs is one fall and a fracture for life to change forever. No amount of insurance money can take away llfe-long pain. And for elderly, touch wood!!!, fractures can be deadly. I don't understand why public spaces don't have coarse and grippy floor. I've seen neighbourhood markets remove perfectly serviceable and rough floor to replace with ceramic/red tiles like these. Vanity and matchy matchy floors aren't great for a silver population.|Good on you for highlighting this.Some HDB blocks have these as well. They are so lethal, it's no laughing matter. I bet countless old people have already kena on these, resulting in bad falls with life-threatening consequences. I don't know why HDB/ URA so cock about our infrastructure, especially with our rapidly ageing population. As a middle-aged person, I almost kena a few weeks ago and although I managed to break the fall it's frightening. Nowadays I wear my special Crocs cafe shoes - those for working in kitchens - whenever it rains.|These kind of tiles are everywhere in SG and I can never understand why.|Write to Tan See Leng and ask him to change the tiles. This is the best year to do it.|I think can feedback to the relevant authorities about this issue and at the same time wear anti-slip footwear. This way, you are protected even at somewhere else.

Only the grippiest of shoes can save you|These tiles are the worst piece of what is otherwise an extremely good infrastructure. And they're everywhere! It's crazy to have such slippery sidewalks in a country that gets rain all the time.|The super rainy weather has led to algae growth, and even a thin layer can make it slippery as heck.

Only shoes or crocs slippers can grip and dont slip.|Why don't singapore used concrete/Tar/Granite kind where people won't slip easily for pavement?Must used this kind of slippery tiles?|The Tom and Jerry mural seems appropriate for the comical amount of falling that has occured from these tiles.|Flat ground is bad, but I've seen these at the end of a slope. Always ""semi slipped"" because going down slope the last step to flat ground have quite a lot of pressure and feet will slip forward|I slipped once and hit the back of my head hard, apart from my elbows which luckily cushioned some of the impact. My phone flew off my hand but luckily I managed to pick it up a distance away. My specs flew off and into the thick shrubs and I never managed to find it. I had to buy a new pair to replace. Whoever decide to use these tiles are f*cking idiots. I shudder to think if it's an elderly who slipped and fell.|Those tactile paving (Lego like) flooring are just as lethal on rainy days especially for those cycling up pavements|Yeah they are but i love gliding along these|I was wearing skirt n I slipped & the rest was history|Thank you URA|And Birkenstocks got no grip|try wearing those $6 flip flops and walk over these tiles, you'll get the free ice skating experience.|*Grandma disagrees*|Trying riding a bike on these..|No surprise why people walk on the roads because of this.|Theres a anti slip chemical that they can use its pretty good |yes, fell more than once, dunno why they ""upgrade"" to these.|Installed to kill elderly ah tiles|Back home we call them grandpa killers.

You wear a jacket when it's cold right? Why don't you wear right shoes when it rains or know it's going to rain or the fact that it's been raining literally for weeks.Why not just buy a pair of waterproof shoes with soles that are designed to grip? Better than wearing running shoes everywhere. It feels like everyone here just complains about stuff without trying to do anything.Like if you have an elderly person, how about you maybe replace their shoes with good soles, the kind designed to grip through water ice and oil. Rather than you know, let the threads of the shoe get worn down more bald than your own car tires.|Is your place still around? I still live in the area and it would be nice to check it out:)|They replaced the tiles in my neighbourhood with these. The old versions were not this slippery when wet. These are crap.|Feedback via one service|That is why they are red in color to hide all the accidents.|It's to prevent the staircase edge from chipping off. Should use the edge guards with grip tape.|Jokes aside, there is a way to walk which reduces the likelihood of slipping. Generally called the ""penguin walk"", the idea is to keep your body over your front legs and minimise how much your legs are spread. The way people normally walk, their bodies would be in the center of their spread legs as they walk. For slippery surfaces like this tile, just making it so you dont stretch your front food forward past your body and not lifting your feet too high off the ground is enough. I got in the habit of doing this even just walking normally, even if my back leg slips I don't usually fall because my front leg can stabilise a lot more easily (plant it straight down rather than it being ahead of my body and thus also likely to slip). For very slippery surfaces, you would want to keep both feet more or less underneath your body as you penguin walk.|That yellow tactile is rubbish. Wonder which genius approved that installation.|yep, those yellow plastic tactile path are a menace. If you are on a bicycle it's a sure fall|yeah i slipped on one of these near my house last weekend. great start to cny...|oh best, i once slipped on one end and then got up, kept walking and slipped on the other end. thanks road|Rubber aint gonna protect you from these tiles|.. and you wear a helmet too.|Condom can ah? |Ouchie I feel you|Report on OneService.|Simple.

Free Crocs?|To reduce the aging demographic.|Definitely not the footwear. I couldnt believe how slippery the sidewalks and walkways in general are in Singapore. Ive purchased numerous pairs or trainers to try and find a pair that arent lethal when the floor is wet.|Yup, live in the area. Sometimes safer to walk on the road if your shoes are too smooth. Besides here, shoes with good grip are important for a number of heritage locations that use similar tiles. I can't remember how many times I've almost slipped in my office shoes near Clarke Quay along New Bridge Road.|Maybe whoever chose these tiles should have used their brain and gotten tiles which are not a safety hazard during wet weather like the person before him did. Maybe choose tiles that fits the average mass market nike slippers instead of asking the public to get special high grip footwear to walk around their neighbourhood.|Absolutely..please wear good footwear during the rains...dont expect tiles to change as per your footwear|""have you tried not to be poor and buy a car instead of walking on these"" town council, probably.|Nope this area is under Marine Parade unfortunately|This!! Muddy and mossy concrete. Just slipped and broke my toe nail today |Bro, you try Neckermann or Havianas.

Wtf is wrong with ppl|The ones at Bras Basah had something poured on them that makes it a lot easier to walk on now|The fact that metal can me made rough too without any additional grip tape is hilarious, they just wanna save that tiniest bit of money|U can still walk normally if your soles have decent traction left, just remember not to slow down abruptly or youll immediately slip. Its ice skating but with your slippers and not as slippery|Or more simply, walk with a slight tiptoe. Only contact the ground with the front 50% of your foot. Rear of the foot just need to be like .5cm off the ground. This is how we run on wet surfaces|aye that's a good tip|So the typical Singaporean walk.|Apart from this, get some good grippy shoes. Helps avoid slip for me most of the time|> those yellow plastic tactile path are a menaceI fell off my kick scooter and ended up lying sideways on the road because of this. :(|i shattered my right kneecap thanks to one.wear a brace for 2 months. and my right knee cap is definitely a different shape when compared to my left.|NO.

Who goes running in the rain?I have a pair of boots I wear everyday and it uses vibram soles, I have not slipped on any floor ever no matter how smooth it looks because the rubber just grips like hell.|Also sandals and flip-flops have some of the worst sole for these. Zero grip, flat af.|But slippers are the best footwear when raining though! Hate wet socks or slimy feet (when wearing pumps)|""we are professionals, we have two cars""|Thank you for the recommendation. My main issue w all the brands is size, my slipper size is 13 and shoe size is 15. Crocs nowadays getting harder and harder to find 13 and shoes i can only get from malaysia stores. Will try the brands you recommend if i can find my size|Sorry if that came off wrong haha. Joo Chiat is full of really nice homes and op gave me the impression it was a great place to live full of great memories. So since they aren't there anymore. Was curious what kind of place it was.|Ohh along the park connector! It's one of my favourite walks to and fro to haig market. The residents in the area made it really walkable with the community gardens.|oh hello former neighbour! yea i noticed alot of those tiles there, thankfully i dont walk much along the joo chiat side, used to go there for supper. the paya lebar central direction more happening and thankfully its sheltered all the way there.|Also a former Haig Road resident, was punked by these tiles many times|No thats horrible!! Sorry to hear that man|Let me put it this way. I used to live in the UK. Rain is the default setting there. I never once had an issue with a single pair of shoes I own. I move to Singapore and notice the issue immediately. Shoes that Ive worn here and considered too dangerous to wear in the rain function absolutely perfectly in the UK. Walking in wet conditions shouldnt feel like youre walking on ice, regardless of the shoes you are wearing.|[deleted]|Birks have good non-slip soles|Absolutely|That's the reason I'm looking into crocs with anti slip soles. Compared to slippers can protect toes and accepted at more places. But haven't found one within budget |Get a decent pair of leather boots and keep em waxed. Your feet will stay dry and warm|You need to find the EUR size. Neckermann I think goes up to EUR45. The US/UK measurement varies across brands, not reliable to buy shoes based on that.|Since when was SG the kind of country where you just check out someone elses home unless its a Show me where you live for $10 tiktok lol|Haha yes! I do miss those gardens and community cats haha|Red wings, both of them use vibram soles, I have one for daily wear and the other as a safety shoe for work. Never had an issue with them on almost every surface except ice. They aren't the most waterproof shoes, but unless you are standing in a puddle of water, they generally keep you dry. Red wings do have waterproof shoes if that's extremely important but you lose the ability to have them easily resoled. CAT and Timbs are consider pretty shit in terms of boots (also docs), majority of the brands you see here are basically selling for fashion and not meant to wear daily for most conditions. Don't take my word for it, you can search for boot teardown and analysis of materials on YouTube. Vibram soles are generally the go to recommendation for most conditions, but you kinda have to choose for the correct situation, but generally if it's on waterproof shoes it should be good for wet weather. But I've heard continental soles are pretty good.I recommend checking out r/boots and r/Goodyearwelt for boot recommendations and what brands are worthwhile.|Absolutely|> can protect toesNot on escalators though :/|It's probably just me. It's really nice to see someone who lives/lived in the same area on the Internet. In hindsight, should have made it sound more like ""did you happen to live where i lived?""|Hope you are able to go bk and visit.

One thing to note, there will be a mall/polyclinic at Parc Residences (west of the junction of Bt Batok Rd/BB West Ave 5) so it might make sense to connect the Brickworks station to thatA lot of people's concern would be the low usage of stations in the Holland area but I think it at least functions well with the transits to other lines and stations like Burgundy might actually have more usage than people would expectI was thinking if Holland Road's station would be better at Dempsey Hill instead, if it were to be further developed in the futureThe central/East branch of this line is much more flexible but I didn't think of it taking over the CCL's branch, that's an interesting idea|Very nice! Love the graphics! Much of what I had in mind in terms of alignment. As someone who lives in the west, I yearn for such line to be a reality one day.|I can see such a line/similar route eventually being built, yes. Well designed. I can see one more line serving the West + Long Island project in 20yrs, and indeed it would be just logical to use the ""dead"" part of the circle line, once the circle is complete.. I can see such line being built in the 2030s, eventually extending to Long Island in the 2040s.|I pity the engineers and contractors that are going to build the new Promenade platforms, it will be a colossal pain to go through the foundations of Suntec City. Also, the distance between Esplanade station and Promenade is so short, and the new platform at Promenade will be even deeper than the existing ones, so I wonder how steep of a gradient will the new tunnel beAnd extending the platform length might cause realignment of the tracks (including crossovers) and tunnel, which means that branch would be effectively shut for many years, or even a decade?|Damn I actually thought this infographic was real for a second.Some comments: I generally support the idea of HLL as an alternative to EWL in the west but I would like to suggest some refinements to your proposal. 1) HLL can be extended from Tawas along Pionner Rd North to serve the residential areas of Jurong West that's not touched by JRL, while also linking up with EWL Pioneer station and a future CRL3 station in the Jurong industrial area.2) Not a fan of the idea of merging this line with CCL Dhoby Ghaut branch as this will limit the line's capacity to just 3 cars, making capacity expansion impossible. Also you need to construct a separate station box at Promenade that's perpendicular to the existing station box and link them somehow without disrupting CCL and DTL ops. This will probably be an engineering nightmare lol. If die die want to link with CCL, I think it would be better to run the line to Stadium (while sharing CCL's tracks and platforms).3) Instead of merging the line with CCL, I think the line has the potential to be extended southwards from Napier to the Keppel/GSW area along Lower Delta Rd, interchanging it with Tiong Bahru and Prince Edward stations before heading to the Long Island. Good effort on the infographic though!|Nah, especially going through so many existing places that no one rarely use mrt and already have purple/blue/brown running through.but something that goes from west to north through bukit batok and touches the yellow line kinda makes more sense.

Is it because of the planned T5 continuation from Sungei Bedok, and maybe that the DTL tracks/signals really do end no further than that station?|Connect Lim Chu Kang/Sungei Gedong pls|Yes.

The original holland line concept end near orchard iirc, so the eastern end is more or less OP's trying to extend it further|The DTL serves Bukit Timah & Hillview. It was built anyway. The TEL serves Tanjong Katong & Siglap. It was built anyway. Point is, good public transport should serve both the poor and also the rich. If they dont serve the rich then it makes it difficult for the rich to have even the possibility of taking public transport.As someone whos not aware of this manifesto prior to this, I think the proposition of what looks like a 30 minute train ride from Tengah to the city is quite compelling. (For context, even when the JRL is built I doubt the journey from Tengah & JID will take under 50 minutes) May not sound like that much, until you realise that could be a difference between an hour long commute from Punggol or Pasir Ris to Tengah, and a hour and 30 minutes.If Tengah & the Jurong Innovation District is the homes and workplaces of the future, they should do this.

Passengers from towns further north (like CCK and Bukit Gombak) also have the option to not use the EWL or the overcrowded DTL. The atas landed areas wont get a lot of ridership, but they do offer connections to a future rapid bus network (thats u/a-meow-cats taichi). Its also why there are few stops between Maju and Dhoby Ghaut.

It's mainly an industrial area while on the fringe of a bunch of HDB blocks.|Super old concept plan did have a holland line that goes along holland road.

Majority of the other estates in the west (Jurong East/West, CCK, Yew Tee, Bukit Batok, Tengah) aren't directly served by it.

CleanTech Park and Hyundais innovation centre have already opened shop inside, and theres massive potential for JID to grow within the next decade|agreed. in atas areas, the ridership mainly comes from students and younger working adults who still live with their families they may live in nice houses, but the truth is that this demographic doesnt have sufficient spending power to take alternate modes of transport, and the public transport also connects them to a wider range of amenities that isnt easily accessible in these areas. also, there would probably be people working there as well and if theyre coming from further away the accessibility would be much appreciated|Clearly you did, can't wait to see the rest of the plan!|Hello u/zeyeeter, would you like to drink some tea?(Not from me hor)|Thats *if* lta decides to build it.Just a few weeks or a month back, someone discussed about seletar line here. But in that thread, someone went so far to claim that lta had scrapped it, choosing to build only a north shore line.Like what use does a mrt line to punggol have? Might as well dont build and reserve the land for seletar later on.Anyway the line was floated in 2019, and since then, every transport related politician had only given a fluff response when asked about it. Doesnt look promising at all, tbh.Edit: This threads OP has also linked the abovementioned comment ([here]( claiming they cannot reveal much about it too.The rumour must have been going around those circles, and might not be just some random assertion, it seems.|I don't think 9th mrt line will cover yishun and sembawang|Oh I see!

Good work btw!Oh and since were chatting, do u think Bukit merah bus interchange can be integrated with a potential mrt station? It is the last bus interchange not connected to an mrt line after all. And the plans to shift it to Tiong bahru is hanging in the air since forever, maybe better chance to have a branch line from somewhere.

Just joining the thought exercise.. haha|omg that sounds super cool, now i kinda wanna get in on this action|Interesting. Assuming this is coming from a credible source, it would confirm my suspicion that the idea had indeed been shelved. The question now is what would happen to upcoming areas like Seletar aerospace and Marina east.|What an immense disappointment if this rumour is indeed more or less confirmed, if its circulating around the transport circles that both you and the original commenter are in.As I had argued back then and will argue it again, who the hell needs an MRT to go from ulu parts of the north to punggol, pasir ris, and far reaches of changi, of all places? Very cost ineffective when theres CRL to go to the east. And the fact it isnt even easy for residents in the north to get to the proposed line in the first place makes it even more ridiculous.Is there so much projected demand from the Malaysians taking the RTS?|The two ends of the platform is mainly the mechanical equipments for the stations. Any extension to platform would need to shift all these away which is a lot of work.|Oh didn't know about it.But as always the limiting factor is not being able to cut through the nature reserve at all, a line that can go under the whole area would be amazing for obvious reasons.|TIL!|i see.|Hmm that's unfortunate. Any guesses why such unreluctance for the West, compared to the East?|Ah, things start to make sense now. Though one thing to note, is that Bayfront is a well utilised station. If the numbers on Wikipedia were cited correctly, Bayfront has similar passenger numbers as Punggol station. Cashew may see more frequent use once CMPB moves there, although I cant say the same for Hume.|Why not both? OP's plan would decrease travel times, and also increase the max throughput between Tengah and the CBD. Would be very useful for Tengah residents.|Never said SLL got scrapped hor, and I didn't say it became NCL instead either o.o|While there is no official layout, based on the schematic shown during the initially announcement, it is possible the line will follow along yishun avenue 8. Depending on how they turn left into woodlands north mrt, it could serve the northern part of sembawang. But it wont be interchange with sembawang or yishun.|Just looked and realised I made a mistake. The full name of TM50 is Transport **Manifesto** 2050, sorry for the confusion. I can't edit the main post so I'll have to leave it at that|Hehe... another line(s) in RMP50 will interest you ;)|why is it not easy for residents to get to the proposed line?|The corridor (between the machine rooms and the platform edge) is sufficiently wide to allow for it to be converted to a safe platform extension|Because the west side (despite Tengah existing) is still largely industrial areas and doesnt have as many HDB estates as the east side. By LTAs train of thought, this means west side = not worth investing in (the plans for CRL Stage 3 havent even been announced yet, after a full 3 years). So the west side is stuck with the 2 legacy MRT lines, and when one fails (Clementi breakdown), the entire region is instantly cooked. We thus wanted to counteract this lack of investment in the west with the HLL, which (along with a few other TM50-planned lines) boosts the connectivity of the west side.|To quote a senior LTA official whom I interacted with, word for word: residential areas get priority in rail planning, and ""most of the west is industrial, which is less prioritised than residential""|Oops, was thinking of Bayshore, or one of the stations along the East branch of TEL|Because the cost of building OP's line would likely outweigh the benefits. The line cuts through the middle of a lot of existing housing estates and other buildings so it would have to be underground. The tunnels must be much deeper than normal to get under these building foundations and the already crowded underground space in the city center. If that isn't enough, the rocks OP wants to tunnel through is largely granite which is very hard (literally) to bore through.Building a whole new line requires far more resources and time than an extension to an existing one. It's easy for OP to draw a bunch of lines on a map and make some nice graphics, but I doubt they actually spent the time to perform the cost-benefit analysis or planned the logistics of constructing their proposal.|Hmm. Interesting.Only familiar with the 1996 master plan calling for a north shore line which vaguely fits and could be cancelled. 1996s was wild and many floated lines were scrapped or changed significantly. Neither 2008 or 2013 transport plans mentioned any northern lines to cancel.Unless it was even older plans? Or something not publicly known?Edit: the post OP also said something about line being very different from preview and that they cannot reveal further.The preview basically just said some line in the north east between NSL and NEL, before going around town but not going into it. The general concept was north - north east - south.If the southern end is rerouted west then OP wouldnt be posting the high effort post here. Even if a change in how its routed around town doesnt make it significantly different from the publicly announced intent.For it to be so different, wouldnt the guess be the axing of either the southern or northern ends, totally transforming the original intent?|but in this sub, it has been hinted that the alignment is very different from what was originally announced in 2019|Ohhhhh okay then ya thats probably why I got confused. Haha thanks for clarifying!|This seems to contradict how LTA/gov projects itself to be forward thinking. The major breakdown being a wake up call, but most definitely they should know how busy Tengah will get in the future (ahem Punggol) and should prioritise the West now. Hope you guys are able to send the message across. Anyways, any clue if they wld confirm CRL Stage 3/JRL west coast extension this time round?|wonder if internally they have a more logical reasoning or rationale, they can't be that stupid, can they? (or are they oops)|Bayshore is being developed into a high density residential estate. Although the East Coast stretch has its fair share of awkwardly placed stations. Like Tanjong Katong, which is located at the ECP exit, making it hard to route connecting buses. Only 2 routes stop at the station. And Siglap, which is located quite far from Siglaps commercial centre at the junction of East Coast and Siglap roads. A silver lining is that redevelopment of the HUDCs at the station may push up some numbers.|The North Shore Line isn't cancelled.[ this feasibility study of the Cross Island Line, the Pasir Ris to Punggol branch is actually labelled as part of the North Shore Line. In fact, this branch has its own set of platforms at Pasir Ris so it's entirely possible that this branch will be extended and act as its own line|my question to the entire subreddit here is why does everyone assume it's the north shore line in lieu of SLL|what we do in RMP50 is not influenced by whatever we hear from inside, if there is even any|Nothing is official anyway. It isnt the first time LTA make changes to their plans. We can speculate all we can but ultimately no one knows the final plan.|During parliment when psp (i think?) ask about the recent breakdown and any redundancies for future, amy khor go answer about the jrl will boost connectivity for the west bla bla bla and basically did not answer the question about providing redundancies for the ew line on the west side|why would they deliberately dumb themselves down in front of young people who may be aspiring to work for them in future?|Doubt it will be a full north shore line honestly. The woodland to sengkang side would be covered by the proposed ""seletar line"". The CRL branch at most extend one or two more station to interchange with the seletar line, which is not enough to be its own separate line. But hey the jurong east extension used to be called the branch line with only 4 stations so who knows (although it is also labelled as a branch of ew line too instead of its own separate line)|MOT took more than five years to make a decision, and to date has not given any response in the affirmative when asked multiple times in parliament. This doesnt look promising for a line they are supposedly close to announcing.The hints in question saying a drastic change to the 9th mrt line. The 9th line was supposed to be going from woodlands north to gbtb.Drastic would imply it either dont go to woodlands or dont go to the south any more.The other part about the new plans mirroring a cancelled line. The northern part of the original sll plans mirrored the proposed north shore line.If the 9th mrt line turns out to be north shore, it still fits. It is a drastic change (no longer going south). It mirrored a cancelled line (north shore wasnt just a fantasy/rumoured line, it was mentioned in 1996s transport white paper, something cancelleable).Back in the 1990s, or so i was told, north shore line was almost going ahead, to the point that it was used to market properties in yishun.Unless this guys [guess]( was correct, and lta decides to build 2 or more lines at once (north shore-ish plus seletar), then isnt it presumed to be either or? Like either the original proposed 9th mrt line concept or replaced by north shore, or a new sll that doesnt go to the north but to punggol instead?Add: assuming northern end of the 9th line didnt change, north shore also fits your other mention about a fitting geographic name.|lmao i laughed so hard reading that speech (and CHT's one), it was just so incredibly illogical it became entertainment material that month, for me.""CCL6 and DTL2e will be useful alternatives to the EWL"" bahahahahahahahaha they can't read maps can they|Fair pointit's unlikely they'd deliberately simplify things without reason.

The rest of the Indian expats come in through the normal s pass and ep route","Leong Mun Wai rebukes accusations of racism by Shanmugam on his Facebook page There He Goes Again Yesterday in Parliament, I had asked a PQ to clarify whether the Government is reviewing the CMIO model in view of what Minister Edwin Tong has said at a recent IPS Conference that the model should be constantly reviewed to reflect Singapores increasingly complex multicultural landscape. I thought this was a reasonable question. But I was caught unawares when Minister Shanmugam suddenly dredged up two old issues and used them to accuse me of racial discrimination. These old issues are already well-documented in the Hansard. I acknowledge that when I raised the CECA issue in Parliament in 2021, there will be some people who will think that there is a racial undertone to it. This is unfortunate, but I have clarified many times that CECA was only raised as a potential economic issue. The debate was necessary because we believe the employment data provided by the Government is insufficient to form a full picture of the employment situation facing Singaporeans. The second issue was about a previous Facebook comment on HDB flats which was unrelated to this issue. I wish to reiterate what I said in the House yesterday, which is that PSP supports the Ethnic Integration Policy. But PSP also notes that the EIP may have caused economic disadvantages to minority communities which need to be addressed. I was speaking to advance the concerns of minorities, and genuinely seeking to represent their interests as a Parliamentarian and fellow Singaporean. I hope that Ministers will not be quick to label Singaporeans as racist when we want to clarify a socio-economic issue even if it touches upon race. (This principle is particularly important because we have just passed the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill on Tuesday). I have brought up many such sensitive issues, such as the sentences given to the PRC citizens involved in the $3 billion money laundering case. I am even more disappointed because it is Minister Shanmugam, who had spent the same six years with me in Raffles Institution, who has been making such allegations against me. Although we were never close friends in school, through our many common friends in our cohort, he should have known me better. After I graduated from RI, I have lived almost continuously for two decades overseas and have cultivated friendships with many schoolmates, co-workers and even customers. These friendships have helped me to develop a deep appreciation of multiracialism and multiculturalism and above all democracy and rule of law. I will always stand for these values and never against them! For Country For PeopleSource: Leong Mun Wais Facebook",-0.02247654652595521,neutral,-0.9402338081359863,negative

Psychological treatment is incredibly subjective. To be frank, you may need to go to several clinics just to find one you're satisfied with. I would recommend you to go to clinics that are out of town since those clinics in upscale areas are definitely more likely to overcharge you or waffle, instead of prioritising your care.|Psychiatrist or psychologist or just counselling talk therapy? Diff charges for all, most should have a general list of charges if you call the clinic or on their website(esp for therapy)|you probably need to change clinics if the psychiatrist is using such tactics. i'll usually get the consultation/hourly price from the front desk clinic staff or website rather than the psychiatrist themselves. they do have fixed prices. if the clinic has more than 1 mental health service provider, they can charge diff rates each. long consult costs more than short consult and i will take note myself to not go over time when im in consult.|Why dont you ask therapists' fees when you call to make an appointment?.

Imposition of fixed prices for psych services in public hospitals would be as a matter of government intervention in the market. In the private sector the market would find the most suitable price structure and price point to reflect the willingness of the clients who are wiling to pay for those unsubsidized services.|idk about psychiatry, but there was an interesting video that i saw before [ seen employment insurance plans with coverage only for mental health care by a psychiatrist. They are charged to a maximum of 10k a year. I can imagine a private psychiatrist practicing some 'talk therapy' for patients who don't want to pay separately for a psychologist. It's at least better than life coaching?As doctors, psychiatrists can even offer MCs for their patients unlike psychologists who can only offer time chits. For people whose employers/HR aren't affected by this increase in claims and are accepting of MCs from psychiatrist, it's like a counselling session. If you are paying directly, you may not be the target audience.|Cos you can't objectively measure the toll a patient has on the psychiatrist.

Many claim to be experts, but without a reliable way to verify their expertise, it can be challenging to know who truly excels in their field.That said, you might want to explore Safe Space for your needs. Their platform allows you to browse psychiatrist profiles, giving you a sense of their background and approach. The pricing for each professional is clearly listed, making it easier to find someone within your budget.If the psychiatrist operates solely online, you may also find them on other platforms. Some professionals have physical clinics while also offering services through Safe Space.Additionally, if you require medication, its worth checking whether the psychiatrist provides prescriptions or if you need to see a separate specialist for that. If medication isnt a concern, Safe Space is a great option for finding a seasoned and consistent psychiatrist.I had a pleasant experience with a psychiatrist on the platform in the past. Interestingly, hes no longer listed there. When I first found him, he was relatively new to the platform and charged only $30 per hour, but after a year, his rate increased to $120 per session.

Some people see it as a machine, as though you change parts, problem solved. But its more an organic system, or, rather, a bunch of systems.Sometimes TCM hints at this, heaty/cooling food reflects a systems approach. But Western medicine tends to take an atomistic approach and deal with symptoms, chemical imbalances, etc.Thats why seeing psychologists may be more helpful or complementary.

Also, religions can be important resources too.I hope we can start looking at humans more humanly and with more care and respect.|Talking about a cure in psychology is absolutely disgusting.

And there are medications for more serious mental illnesses like depression, but psychiatry helps to correct the psyche to no longer need the medication, if only no longer as badly.|My company covers mental care in general but $10k is frankly quite a bit.

It's up to them.

As the barrier went up and I drove forward, someone on an ebike raced through on my left, to also get through. Because of the road, he had to go as quick as he could to get straight in front of my car, as there was no space for him to be alongside me. I had no idea he was there at all until he suddenly appeared in front of me.I had to slow immediately (obviously I wasn't going at any kind of speed as I had stopped at the barrier) and beeped my horn. He reacted angrily, pointing at his eyes as if it was my fault that I hadn't seen him! I'll be honest, I was annoyed and for a couple of seconds considered going alongside him and winding my window down - but I realised there was no chance of a reasonable conversation so I just let him go off.Now had I hit him, it would have been his fault (and my camera would have shown this) but more importantly he would have been the one injured. I'd have had a scratch on my car but I would be completely unhurt. So I guess I'm writing this post to remind cyclists and electric bike riders that a driver in a car has much less awareness of you than you might think. I see cyclists at night on the road, wearing black, no helmet, with no lights on their bike - drivers CANNOT see you until the last moment, and that's not because they're not paying attention. Some car drivers are selfish, impatient, make dangerous manoeuvres - completely correct to say that. But cyclists are so much more exposed and likely to be hurt. Please cycle as if the car driver has no idea you are there!",-0.9691699140071869,negative,-0.9701331374645233,negative

Singaporeans from all races form our membership, CEC leadership and GRC candidate slate. Our Nee Soon GRC candidates in GE 2020 is a good example. We readily fielded Caucasian, Chinese, Malay and Indian candidates, and will continue to do so. We are a party where all races have a voice.2) PSP stands for national issues.

But they also affect the well-being and livelihood of every Singaporean. As such, we will continue to be fearless when speaking up in Parliament on national issues.3) Finally the PSP stands for mature politics. I hope the Minister will be slow to label Mun Wai or the PSP as racist just because of some isolated incident or statements. Isolated lapses affect all parties and we should careful not to go overboard with our comments especially when they concern the highly flammable issue of race. For instance, when a minority MP from the Ministers GRC vacated her seat mid-term without replacement, would it be fair to say that the PAP cares little for minority representation?

Maybe you time the duration it takes from your origin to destination, then calculate the speed from the LTA page?  me NSL is slightly over 40km/h, which is pretty good. My stopwatch starts the instant the doors close at the origin, then stop the instant the doors open at the destination. Using the same methodology: EWL: about 30-35km/h, CCL: about 30km/h, DTL: about 40km/h, TEL: about 45km/h before Stevens, about 35km/h in town area, about 40km/h after GBTBYou can also download a GPS speed tracker app on your phone to see how fast the train is travelling :)|Are you saying this due to recency bias from the faults in the last few days or in general?|what is DAE?|Could be post-track maintenance speed restrictions, coupled with [energy-saving measures]( implemented in the automatic train control system. I've personally noticed the northbound stretch between Bishan and Ang Mo Kio being relatively slow during off-peak hours, but operating at full speed during peak hours|I have a theory. Let us assume it is peak hours right now and trains have to travel at around a 2 min interval. Let us assume that at Ang Mo Kio trains have to wait at least 30 seconds. Let us say, there is an incident and the train has to wait for around 1.5 min to leave, this can happen when say someone fainted or someone pushed the emergency button or so on.After the incident, the gap from the train in front is 3.5 min and the back is only .5 min. So, now it has to catch up by 1.5 min. However, if the trains are constantly moving at top speed of 80 km/h, there is no opportunity for the middle train to catch up without closing the doors very quickly. So at these slow sections, the first train will proceed slowly while the second train will move quickly, this will then help narrow the gap significantly until they are back to the 2 min interval.The best part is that the third train which has the 0.5 min interval can continue normally(nearly, it will still be a tad bit slower). Hence, I think the reason a train is moving slowly is to allow less deviations in schedulesEdit: Do let me know if there are any discrepencies or misleading info.

Different vendors' systems have different names for it, some call ATP (Automatic Train Protection), some call ATC (Automatic Train Control). All different fancy names but with the same function. So this server at the same time is also talking to all other trains. Through this, it knows where all trains are, and can work out how fast and how far a train can go before it hits another train. This server then tells every single train how fast and how far they can go. This conversation is non-stop. If this conversation stops, even if its just a short instant , the signalling system treats entire line as dangerous and stops ALL trains and cut off power (depending on the technology too). It does this because when a train stops talking/answering, it cannot be 100% confirm plus chop to be sure of where the train is if even one train is missing, they stop the entire line for safety reasons. But this server does not work alone. At the same time it is talking to other systems like platform doors, signal lights, switches, and even the railway track itself!

But they forgot the distances between the two ends of the station can be quite significant, and its annoying to walk from one end to the other.Yes one can always preload to know which exit to take via Google, but thats not how its supposed to work, so in the end the TEL stations have these A4 paper signages (Great World too) to help in wayfinding, which shows how stupid the planners are (do they even take the mrt themselves?)Yes I feel quite strongly about this cos I use different TEL stations irregularly to suffer from this problem.|The minimalist ""enhanced"" signage is quite terrible imho.|Went to Maxwell recently.

Once on the ground level you should be greeted with the information board and map directing you which exit to use.|> The clutter of paper signs is one of many reasons why Lim initially embarked on redesigning the signage system in 2015. The then BA(Hons) Design Communication student at LASALLE College of the Arts saw paper signs as not just confusing, but literally paper over the cracks of a broken system. For his graduation project, Lim proposed a simplified signage system, which he eventually posted online. It somehow found its way to LTA, and he was invited for a chat, which turned out to be a job interview.> [In Conversation with: Samuel Lim on redesigning Singapore's subway signage]( I think the failure of the new way finding system is in the implementation. The design (because it has so little actual information) becomes very sensitive to implementation issues. For example, a lot of how you understand the little information you are given comes from context, so in the new system signs indicating a lift route that diverges from the main route are simply denoted by the lift icon and you're supposed to know this lift is associated with this specific main route. So if they removed the platform level map which gives the context (which they did in TEL3 if I remember correctly) and refuse to label the exits on the signs you would get super duper confused. If you wanted to implement such a system you'd have to really think about what elements are most effective at telling people what most of them want to know at that point in time, but that's a lot of effort and I think if the commenter below who claimed he was from the design department is to be believed LTA simply got too ambitious.Also I think the new design is unnecessarily allergic to words. In Punggol Coast station they (tweaked?) it so that ""Punggol Digital District"" is in a square box to ""icon-ise"" it but its ugly and frankly wouldn't have been necessary if they made a provision for short text.|Small update!  signboard in TEL Stevens stations are super bad.

Hence the group think|What's more likely is that LTA engaged a architect 'consultant' to provide advise on wayfinding. This work is subsumed under the scope of the architect, but with so much manpower crunching, the work of the wayfinding design gets redelegated to the smallest guy in the company who's already overloaded with many other projects.So they'll take the easy way out and smoke and bullshit their way through with LTA that this wayfinding proposal is the best and they've done with the best survey work etc. They'll present to senior management that this design is a breakthrough and with tight timeline to deliver, LTA will approve, believing the words of the consultant.At the end of the day, the consultant is laughing his way to the bank and the public is stuck with lackluster design.|Given so many Singaporeans travel to Japan annually they sure couldve learned something from signage design in Japanese metro stations?Tokyo Metro has one of the clearest and typographically clean signs Ive ever seen.

Some classmates asked him how is his discussion even relevant to the concepts we were supposed to cover for class.And to top it off, I got the worst grade despite me being active for class participation, and working my butt off to constantly work on and review my RP. If that wasn't enough, the comments written in for the RP, said this will affect my entry to the Bar since he repeated time and time again about plagiarism. My RP was flagged for plagiarism and certain interpretation of the concepts that he thinks I got wrong. Really killed off every hope I had in wanting to do well for my final exam for Consti and my cGPA.To balance out the seemingly scathing undertones readers might have from this thread, he is knowledgeable regarding Consti or political matters. But he would have made a better researcher or pundit on politics otherwise IMO.But I can't continue to keep ruminating and angry over this. No point blaming anyone or anything. Anyway, I have to accept it as another vicissitude of life and move on regardless whether I'll get to qualify for the Bar Exam or give up pursuing a legal career and go elsewhere.(HUGE DISCLAIMER): Once again to anyone reading this, this isn't a directed criticism towards anybody. But anyone who is curious about how certain experts featured on media are like off the spotlight or in person, that is my personal experience of what it's like to study in this module.|Yes and no. See Donald Low and PJ Thum, both academics who are persona non grata within the Singapore academic system.

For me there are folks I met during my working life that no matter how much you please them they ain't gonna be please with you, or the super toxic ones, is with anyone.What I normally do when I get to know my superiors is like project management, I slyly try to pry out what are like their deliverables and expectations, and then decide if I am in that firing range of their D&E. If yes, then I ask how to accommodate the best of my abilities, if no, not my effing problem unless he/she explicitly asks. Over time, I just observe whether my working relationship with my boss's D&E aligns, whether the boss is clueless about what is going on, or whether the boss is having a huge gap of reality of his/her D&E and their own emotional short term demands. The first is healthy, the second is to your advantage, the third is totally unpleasable even if they come face-to-face whichever God they pray to|I like the new word i learnt called vicissitude. Thank you for sharing|I appreciate your frank statement about Prof. Tan.As usual, this is probably going to be your (and my) lesson on, ""Not everyone who presents themselves well on media is a well-meaning person up-close.""|> My RP was flagged for plagiarism and certain interpretation of the concepts that he thinks I got wrong.TurnItIn actually does a pretty good job identifying non-paraphrased content|the difference between your two examples and Eugene is that the two went head to head with official narratives several times. PJ Thum openly challenged critical narratives with his [research]( while Donald had started on his book and was involved in a publication critical of state policies compared to these two, Prof Tan's comment on the handouts are still quite tame. i don't dispute the political stance part - I've known SMU profs who were pressured / called up due to their critical views and they left SG eventually.so the only factor left as I said imo is Prof Tan's involvement in legal work and research. his smu [page ]( suggests lesser publications in recent yearssurprised you did not mention Daniel Goh, who is still doing well at NUS before and after his WP involvement.|coffeeshop rentals are on the free market. if these stalls were already under cost pressures and now they know diners can pay (using ahgong money), they may just collectively increase price, gradually or otherwise. i know of people who spend it all on zichar at one go anyway. rather that open the link to pay each time|But that's unfortunately one aspect of cost push inflation. Because of the form of help the government provide, the double edge sword of that benefit will be like suppliers increasing cost because they know part of it is and will be subsidised by the government(aka utilizing the vouchers)For example, although the annual vouchers for young children below six are a great idea, what I forsee is importers/suppliers will start to raise prices of any goods related to babies & young children.Another example is that since every household has the SG voucher and one usage is for Groceries, why not put shares on Seng Shiong since it is as good as you your purchase is partially subsided by the government if you use the vouchers for your payment? But wait, we are in a capitalist system whereas shareholder earnings are important right?this will result in increasing prices of goods again to meet that objective. There is competition with basic supply and demand principles without a doubt, and eventually prices will stabilise.|> And he was pretty sore about it.Did he tell you this personally?|Yeah. But then, the media's poor choice of selecting my former Prof will create the wrong perception that Singapore lacks sufficient subject matter experts like economists besides Song Seng Wun on financial matters, including the Budget and its impacts on ordinary Singaporeans.You might say that it isn't necessary for someone with an Econs degree to be only qualified to talk about Singapore's economy and fiscal spending. But I'm saying that this is really a mismatch for someone like him to comment about the Budget and how it will truly affect ordinary folks. Unless the media wants to paint a narrative to the public of how the release of the Budget together with the underlying intentions of the Singapore Government correlates with the timing of the upcoming general elections this year, I don't see any reason for someone like him to be there in the first place.|Thank you so much for your advice @Weir-Doe. Even if I really don't make it to the legal field as a lawyer, I still want to give back to society one way or another while I'm still young (not really young though).I'm not going to make law school or my grades a defining part of my future. I will just take things in my stride and learn to thrive anywhere I go. I wish you well kind stranger. |Yeah but I did put in quotation marks each and every single time for the statements I lifted and tagged them to the relevant sources accordingly. Besides, I've followed the required academic citation style required for my paper. And this was not my first time having to let Turnitin vet through my research papers prior to this module. I was well aware of the necessity to keep the plagiarism to a very low level (BELOW the maximum accepted level of plagiarism). So I found it incredibly puzzling and shocking that he flagged mines for quite a high plagiarism rate. Still, what to do. Mind you, as noted in my previous comment, I've already worked on it time and time again by not only constantly editing and reviewing, but even trying to ensure that the citation style is followed according to the school's requirement. When the prof stated plagiarism itself is an issue, I've followed the requirements strictly and closely as it is. I note it's nothing to take lightly at all.Turnitin isn't entirely the best in sieving out academic plagiarism from what I've read online but once again, no point blaming the plagiarism software since it is what it is.I have not faced this issue for my other subjects which required research papers too. I've been doing quite a number of research papers and checked everything for content and citation style presentation prior to Consti Law. But alas, this unfortunate issue still happened. Till date, this was my worst performing research paper thus far. I've done much better for the rest of my 8 other RPs.|They may collectively increase price, but there are thousands of hawker stalls in SG. I strongly doubt there will be a 100% move. As with all things, the population (of hawker stalls) will respond on a continuum, with some raising prices and some not.And we as consumers have the freedom to choose to spend our vouchers at the stalls that maintain price, or the stalls that increase price.As far as economic stimulus goes, I much prefer this direct-to-consumer version compared to any subsidy at the business level.|It seems like this article was taking a more political view of the Budget rather than doing an economic analysis since they interviewed pol analysts rather than economists.|Did you clarify with Prof Tan on the problematic parts in your paper? If I recall correctly, students are allowed to get access to the TurnItIn Report - did you ask for that? If you didnt do both of these, it wouldnt be fair to whine without the relevant caveats.|2 things though, firstly i was referring to coffeeshops where landlords are mostly greedy. secondly, you called vouchers economic stimulus, which is exactly my point that it drives inflation|Sure.I don't see how that my point changes by saying coffeeshops vs hawker stalls. Even if all the coffeeshop holders will take coordinated action to raise rents, hawker stalls provide much the same function, and consumers are free to take their custom there.Singapore's version of the free market often (not always) includes subsidised, public-run options that are meant to keep the private sector honest (see healthcare for another example, and by right NTUC and Singtel were supposed to be examples too, but the govt seemed to forget this concept for a few decades in the privatisation wave).And yes, I called it economic stimulus. I prefer economic stimulus to no economic stimulus - the point is to redistribute the wealth in favour of the lower income. Again, I much prefer this version of stimulus to some of the others I've seen.","Something has happened to our resident political observer Prof Tan >SMU's Prof Tan felt that while the grants and subsidies will help to some extent, they cannot address the ""dominant belief that Singapore has become too expensive"", even for Singaporeans.

The 5% percenters were very happy, because they were perceived to be at the top2 years later, the company was doing well, best performers were getting 25-30% raises, whereas the average performers were getting 10% raisesThe average performers this time were very pissed off, even more so than my first year. How is it that someone is getting so much more than me? Even though their average raise was higher than industry standardsTherein lies the unhappiness - is not about the absolute value, its how it fares with someone elsePS. this does not apply to industries that are underpaid and have a legitimate reason for being upset|My take:It's only human nature that most people think that they are doing more/better.And it's also human nature to desire for more?When was the last time that you hear someone actually saying that they're not good/paid more than they deserve, etc?So it's almost nigh impossible to find any survey/study that shows that workers are happy (especially with their salary).|I never understood the argument of those in finance being overpaid.

Because who the fuck wants to be average in this country. Probably only 25% of people above the median will be happy.

Indians and especially Malays are significantly overrepresented in drug abuser statistics. This is a significant contributor to the overrepresentation of minorities in prison, given that drug abusers make up 30% of the prison population in 2023.  other countries, the war on drugs is accepted to be racially biased and reformative justice means that the war on drugs is softened. If we don't accept that the war on drugs is racially biased, minorities will continue to be disproportionately incarcerated.The war on drugs in Singapore also creates a war on people struggling with addiction. The wealthy can go overseas for drug rehab. The well off can do drug rehab locally. The average and poor who are disproportionately minorities (if migrant Indians get sent to DRC instead of their home countries) get sent to DRC where they don't get pharmaceutical support in treating addiction (bupropion, naltrexone, methadone etc) and they're treated like prisoners. So due to the socioeconomic distribution among the races, minorities struggling with drug addiction are disproportionately treated as prisoners and added to prisoner statistics. This is compounded by community specific advice to report your children to the police to save them from drug addiction, instead of going through private rehab where they actually could have a better chance at treating their addiction.|Your points need to comprehend meh?|[deleted]|> Theres only something wrong if youre SJWing or incompetent or lying to get your way or telling people to riot or something.The reddit post I'm linking to from 5 years ago literally talks about her blocking people and ignoring any questions about her political stance, as well as being extreme on things like questioning Singapore's judiciary (regardless of your view on that, it's just bad pragmatics to do that as an electoral candidate)Yes, there's nothing wrong being from the progressive left (although Angela Davis is a literal communist and a member of the communist party CPUSA), but then you shouldn't be surprised when someone like that imports the same rhetoric and style as those she admires and follows (I.e.

If the economy is totally dependent on oil for energy then this will present a real shock at some point in the future. So the goal is to encourage migration from oil based energy to renewables, but of course the problem is that at the moment renewables are more expensive due to a need for lots of R &D spending and also lower volume.

The impact of higher power price due to the tax on power plants supports investment case for greener alternatives. For example, with a higher power price, solar panel investments are almost a no-brainer.\- shifts heavy scope 1 emission industries away to more power-based (which is then linked to above point) or lower-energy intensive ones. Not sure if this is the intended effect but could be an economic justification.\- Stay ahead of preparedness in a world where carbon is taxed globally. Counter-point: Trump's USA and recent walk backs on sustainability commitments may mean trying to be too ahead of the curve costs us. Counter-counter-point: EU CBAM starting 2026 may push many countries (e.g. China) to enact their own carbon tax to keep income from carbon tax flowing to EU. SG industries exposed to EU CBAM in the future will also have less penalties as carbon taxed in SG can qualify for the adjustment if importing to EU.|Economic argument:1. Govt has to get revenue from somewhere2. Better to impose taxes on bad things with bad externalities than good things3. Carbon pollution is a bad thing. So tax it instead of taxing something else thats less worse. Sorry if that is too dumb a response but honestly these are the bottom line principles that get lost in people moaning about climate treaties etc. But on that front I would add:4. Singapore is completely existentially fxxked in the long term if the whole world doesnt take action to slash emissions asap. Todays prosperous SG will not survive 1-2m of sea rise. 5. Singapore is a high income country (GDP per cap)6. Lower income countries wont act if high income countries dont act 7. A carbon tax demonstrates Sg is taking action. QED|Incentivize companies to control their energy usage or seek greener solutions. Singgov has always been using costs as a means to get corporations to align themselves with the policies, not just dangling carrots.|seems like you got the answer. there is no easy economic justification. I guess you could say that without a livable earth there is no economy. but Singapore has one of the highest carbon emission per capita in the world. so maybe we should get it in our heads that we need to be more environmentally conscious. I see arguments like we are but a drop in the ocean. But then so is every person in the world. You can say the same thing about one person not doing NS. Or one person stealing.|There are lots of THEORETICAL arguments for the carbon tax but my opinion is that in reality, it is nothing more than a greenwashing exercise. Carbon tax regimes aim to make 'dirty' goods or activities more expensive relative to 'clean' ones. This sounds great in theory but more often than not, it raises absolute costs for people. Worse still, in a lot of cases, it raises costs for no actual environmental benefit as the cleaner alternatives are simply not technically feasible. Another explicitly stated goal of SG's carbon tax is to fund a transition to cleaner industries. I've tried googling around but so far, other than really small scale initiatives such as the household grants to buy more efficient appliances or maybe some corporate workforce grants here and there, I don't see any big initiatives for industries or companies to transition. At least not to the tune of the billions that are being collected today from the manufacturing sector. Some others have mentioned turning SG into a green hub. This is laughable. Wtf does this actually mean? What kind of jobs can this create other than ESG consultancies? Can they replace the thousands of jobs that are in the impacted manufacturing sector today? Can they sustain secondary industries such as logistics and shipping which have helped turn SG into a global trading hub?Either way, realities bite back hard. Why do you think the govt had to step in to give up to 75% rebates on carbon tax to the petchem sector? This goes back to OP's original question... as it stands, SG is already a difficult place for manufacturers to survive, let alone thrive.

TEL's T251 seems to have much worse noise isolation when compared to other rolling stock, and supposedly it runs faster, hence more noise generation. The former is much more obvious when you compare the R151 and the now defunct C651. When passing through the notorious CBD stretch where it turns a lot, the R151 seems to block out the sound much better than the older rolling stock. I do hope they improve the noise isolation though. While it is within safe limits, it is really unbearable and I remember how much of a nuisance it was trying to catch some shut eye when taking the TEL to camp, especially in the wee hours of the morning.|due to a very tight track arc and no, it is abnormal and prior articles have discussed that it hits dangerous decibel levels for passengers|The TEL also partixularly noisy cause there's alot of bends in it.

I know with this intensity need a certain duration then it will cause hearing loss, but even few seconds also cannot tahan liao!!!!!!!It's so bad that I MUST wear noise cancelling earbuds if I need to travel this part of the TEL. Otherwise I'll just take bus.|Newer MRT lines have a lot of twists and turns due to the crowded undergroud space. Twists? Yes! At some locations (especially curves), the track tilts at a very shallow angle to allow trains to round a curve at a higher speed (for passenger comfort). In railway terms its called a ""cant"". Train wheels are actually conical and can negotiate curves without relying too much on the flange (the inner edge of the wheel that is larger than the outer edge). When the line has too many tight curves, trains start to rely on their wheel flanges, and this causes noise. Not just noise, it also wears out the wheels very fast and trains have to spend more time in the workshop getting their wheels fixed. In KL the twists and turns are so bad that the wheels wear out faster than the rate that they can be profiled / replaced. Here it seems like the newer lines are also having the same issues with tight curves. One solution is to run the trains slower, but at the cost of travelling time. However, there are new technologies that can help reduce the noise issue. I am not sure whether they are used here, but in other countries they install special pads under the tracks to reduce the noise, skirt panels on trains, and also a system that can apply a special liquid to the wheels to reduce friction and noose. Another thing is MRT doors are usually sliding doors. Trains that run longer distances like commuter trains, intercity trains and HSRs often have sliding plug doors (similar to the rear door of most buses here). They form an airtight seal to keep the noise and heat out. Sliding plug doors are not that common in MRT kind of usage (though HK and many cities in China use them) because of the mechanical complexity and cost.|TEL trains are made by the same supplier of the older NSEWL trains which also have noise issues underground, think the manufacturer cheaped out on the noise insulation.|Yes.

LMAO|You are half right. Noise on trains are primarily due to soundproofing and track irregularities. The TEL trains have more doors than normal, to deal with commuters not optimsing carriage space by crowding by the door. The extra doors make the soundproofing worse. Next, the TEL tracks twist and turn a lot more than the older lines, as it goes through many built up areas to the target stations. This creates a lot more grinding noise between the rolling stock wheels and the track. Bumps on the tracks would also contribute to the noise too, but given the young age of the tracks, this is unlikely the main noise contributor.|Perhaps it wasnt there |Also some sections of track in the tunnel may be floating-slab track, which reduces vibration transmitted to overlying buildings (a common situation given how urbanised Singapore is) but [results in greater noise within the tunnel]( trains on the TEL faster than other lines? it does feel faster|That just makes me appreciate the Shinkansen much more.The Tohoku line is the fastest at 320km/h and there are sections of it that's tunnel.

Sometimes, people do complain about things without realizing that is it ""normal"". The example I remember is Greece complaining that their new submarines (new at that time) rolled a lot when surfaced.

So I'd say ""find out"" before deciding if it is something wrong or just something not familiar.|idk why people keep comparing MRT to the shitty UK trains we have the EW like for what, 30+ years?? and it was quiet as fuck. we know how to build quiet trains but somehow people keep comparing ourselves to other shitter train system rather than what we achieved before|If you go China and take their metro train.

The loudest trains in the London Underground are ~50+ years old, they're some of the *oldest* rolling stock there is. The TEL is *brand-new* and cost *billions* to build. The Elizabeth line is brand-new and quiet as a mouse inside the cabin, especially because the [Class 345 rolling stock]( have sliding plug doors that sit flush with the train body in the closed position, thus massively reducing NVH inside the cabin. The Piccadilly line 1973 stock will be progressively replaced this year too, and they've managed to reduce cabin noise quite significantly.|when someones first response is to point elsewhere, they dont really care about the problem|I believe in the past, there were works to add more pads or something like that in green line, to make the journey smoother, does it also make it quieter also?|ya I agree. must compare against ourselves to improve and not to compare anyone that is worse than us|I dont think that its quiet.Just tolerance level to consistent and not consistent noise.

More sidewalks too. And more ways for people to complete the last mile. We had a good thing going once with PMDs actually, I remember using Grab's escooter rentals to buy lunch at work for a few months. Perhaps what's actually lacking is the surface space to accommodate these + walking pedestrians. I think the accidents attributed to Peds vs PMA were not only caused by irresponsible user behaviour, which definitely is hard to solve, but also indicative of the limited space to allow both to exist in the same space.I just took a look at the whole North South Corridor project, apparently some of the streets on the surface will be repurposed to encourage ped friendly spaces?

All of these issues with PMAs, PMDs, ""errant riders"" etc won't be a major issue if the government just turned one lane on each side of the road into a ""protected active mobility lane"". That's how they do it in other countries, and e-scooters are still a thing there, instead of being regulated out of existence like in Singapore.We have every reason to do this. Most people don't drive, yet most of our road space is dedicated to it. Singapore is land-scarce, yet we waste 12% of it on the most land-inefficient transport method possible.

We care way more about the dangers of unregulated PMDs relative to other forms of transport. Especially when dealing with one usually comes at the cost of another (I.e. Dedicated third spaces for PMDs/bike lanes come at the expense of roads).|maybe instead of blaming the government, perhaps you can look at yourself to see if you have done your part.

But so does COE, ERP and taxes. The difference is that the latter generate important revenue, dont make us dread taking a public bus when MRT is not enough, dont create air and noise pollution, dont impact businesses who depend on logistics, and ensure that we can get an ambulance or a fire engine in a timely manner when we most need it.|See, the problem is you're only looking at space. A journey of a car is more efficient than the journey of a train. Not for the government, but for the commuter.

Why are the green waves not synced to biking speeds?> It's fasterWhy are buses forced to give way to cars, while carrying so much more people? Why do buses have to be stuck in traffic jams on the expressways, instead of having a dedicated peak-hour lane for them to be faster? Why do we not take the money we spend on building expressways, and use it to build expresstrains -- that can go much faster than 90km/h -- instead?Each one of those decisions made it faster and more comfortable to commute by car, while making it worse for commuters, cyclists, and walkers. Unfortunately, not everyone can indulge in this speed and comfort. But if we prioritise commuters, cyclists, and walkers instead, we *can* make it faster and more comfortable for everybody, not just those who can afford to ride or drive a car.|Sad to see youre getting downvoted, but absolutely true and you had to state obvious facts for oblivious people.

And it also doesn't carry a load.>while cars get overbuilt roads?You answered your own question. The government might be occasionally dehumanising, but it's usually not stupid. Why are roads overbuilt? Because they're not built for cars. Expressways are built for cars, sure, but all your sidestreets? Those are built for such vehicles as cranes, trailers, firetrucks, ambulances. Roads aren't going anywhere. Huge vehicles are a basic necessity for society to function. And seeing as you can't just roll up and deploy roads as and when you want, they need to always be there. Might as well use them for fast, comfortable travel in the 99% of the time emergency services and construction isn't being done.That said, part of the left lane should be given to bicycles. But then again, cyclists need to be less entitled and cowardly.>why are buses forced to give way to cars,That's just untrue. Buses have right of way by default. Youre supposed to drive in such a way that the bus is delayed as little as possible, if at all. People being assholes is a separate issue.>dedicated peak-hour lane for them to be faster?They literally have these on most roads that experience congestion. The government wants us to take trains for the bulk of our journeys, so the few expressway buses are more or less ignored. I prefer bus to train, but I admit that it's just prudent to take the train if you want to skip the traffic.> it faster and more comfortable for everybodyWe can make it less slow, you mean. To make walking and cycling actually viable requires the entire city to be planned around it. It's not a series of small decisions. It's decades of construction. The fact is, the car is simply more powerful. While so much trouble needs to be put into making other modes bearable, the car is by default great, with just any drivable surface, which, as I said, you need to pave anyway.Now I want you to really ask yourself this. Based on our government's track record, if we properly achieve 15 minute towns or whatever, how difficult do you think they're going to make it to go further than that? In my opinion, they will ""strongly motivate"" us to just stay within our little areas and not venture out. Trains don't really cost $2. That's heavily subsidised (another point about which gets supported more). Travel from Changi to Jurong will be considered a luxury, subsidies will vanish, and we'll have to pay $5 each way. Or maybe $10 to support free transport within those little towns. Good luck to you if you want to exercise your freedom to go where you please. We are currently ""allowed"" to choose to go anywhere we want because for many of us, it's not a choice.|Affordable EV + solar/hydroelectric power + more charging points. Problem solved.|There are schemes such as Weekend Cars, Off-Peak Cars where they can only be used on certain time and day, but of course if everyone have these, the traffic will just be as bad during those period.|Now youve descended into 15 minute city conspiracy theory nonsense.|Cars are not inherently faster than walk/cycle/ride. When you take into account red lights, needing to find parking, congestion (from other cars blocking you), and express trains safely travelling faster than 90km/h, walk/cycle/ride can be a lot more competitive and accessible for the average citizen. Emergency services can use bidirectional bike paths, bus lanes, etc. Every time you see an ambulance blocked behind cars at a red light, realise that if the cars were bikes, the people can just dismount and get out of the way.|False.

Hahahah.. you wait long long.|You bring up slowdowns for cars, but don't consider their magnitude. If you've ever walked by a road, you'll know that stopping for a minute or even 5 isn't going to let a walker get much ahead of a car.I don't support taking cars for short distances. But the fact remains, when you need to walk 10mins to and from the MRT, any journey outside the CBD involving the train is almost certainly going to be faster by car. Only in the CBD is parking actually an issue, as it should be. I believe the CBD should be considered more or less a single building, with some lifts moving sideways called trains.Roads are built for heavy vehicles. An ambulance never has to be stuck behind cars. We're just assholes. In Europe, cars will diagonal park along the sides and shoulders when sirens are heard.|> Cars are not inherently faster than walk/cycle/ride. Absolutely not true. Try walk/cycle/ride from Sengkang to NTU, or Kovan to Changi Jewel and you will see. > When you take into account red lights, needing to find parking, congestion (from other cars blocking you)Absolutely not an issue unless youre headed to the heart of the CBD during peak hours, or you are intentionally trying to avoid expressways for some odd reason while heading between towns. Parking is readily available in MSCP and malls in basements where no one would use as a green space, and most workplaces outside CBD. If anything, congestion is a sign of an overcrowding problem.

The moment you have to change (walk and wait), or wait for more than a few stops for others, the time adds up considerably. Express trains decelerate and accelerate slowly, not to mention boarding and alighting time, and arent suited for intercity other than island-end-to-end trips. There is a reason why most express buses and night riders do not run outside of a tight peak hour, with horrible frequency - because itd be way more inefficient than a car if its not crush-loaded, though slightly faster only compared to regular buses, up to 60km/h. And when they do implement express trains Id imagine it to be the same. > walk/cycle/ride can be a lot more competitive and accessible for the average citizen.Every time I cycled in the past or walked a considerable distance for a bus, I would always turn up at my destination in a puddle of sweat - when I arrived I got asked if it was raining outside. And thats with my prescribed hyperhidrosis meds. And yes, I do gym in AC. Singapore is not windy and stuffy due to tall concrete buildings which when combined with the humidity of the area, makes for very unpleasant outdoor activities when you arent particularly looking for it, like meeting a group of friends for lunch at a mall.

Then buses and trains will be more comfortable, will not take too long at stops, and EVs with hydroelectric power would be cheap, readily available, efficient and sustainable for anyone who wants to get one for trips that dont fall within the perfect urbanists vision.To date, for such intercity trips, I have not seen any city in the world have a faster commute by transit than car, when both car infrastructure and public transit is sufficient to support the number of users (i.e. not artificially crippled) with a seat for almost everyone, and when counting housing outside of the absolute centre where it would be horribly expensive otherwise.|EVs have regenerative braking via motor and magnets which is quite strong, and when properly set up you dont have to touch the brake most of the time. And when the brakes, which should be present, are used, the brakes provide benefits that objectively massively outweigh the minuscule amount of dust produced. I guess I can assume you dont have or want brakes on your bus, train and bicycles either. Good luck with you and your brakeless fixie bike lol. Just dont blame cars or complain when you actively choose to put yourself in harms way to save 4000 people a year, or hit a bunch of peds who decided to walk in front of you and go to jail. Cars have massively improved and they are at the point emissions are well under control. If you are 1 of the 4000 getting sick from brake dust, please go to a hospital. You wont survive being next to a campfire, cooking on a gas stove, BBQ, or pretty much most day-to-day activities, let alone walking past a bunch of people smoking and minding their own business.","With the upcoming PMA rider requirement, restrictions on what device can and cant go where, I found this comic which sums up pretty much how I feel walking in Singapore is. Like the public transportation is fantastic and all once youre on board, the areas going to and from the public transport really leave a lot to be desired.",0.6922330199241638,positive,0.24576393108367922,positive

I was charged $1.19 for this 1 stop journey from Outram Park. But I understand that tapping out and in at the same station restarts a new trip. This was my fault so it makes sense that I pay $1.19 separately here.3:37PM - 4:10PM Chinatown NEL - Tampines DTL $2.02 4:15PM - 4:29PM Bus 296 $1.19A maximum of 5 transfers can be made on a single journey right? That makes Bus 296 the 2nd trip, or 3rd if we decide to include the first trip from Outram Park. Either way, its not more than 5 transfers, and the full trip is still under 2 hours. So Bus 296 should still be connected to the Chinatown - Tampines MRT trip and lumped as one single MRT-Bus journey, right?|Hmm, what do you mean by waiting for the transaction to be confirmed? This journey was made 29th January, so it should be finalized by now right?|Please write to lta to ask them to act on this. Probably many dont know.|It's quite crazy now the fares. In just 5 days over 25 sgd was spent just on transport itself. I stay separate from family so I usually make about 3 trips a day from home to work, work to family sometimes or to another site also for work and then from wherever I am back to home. It's insanity. The amounts they have been overcharging us. My transport fees never ever exceeded 50sgd a month before in the past 5 years. No matter how much I travelled. But suddenly in the past 3 months its gone beyond 80 a month. Its truly crazy.

The data from bus may not be in. And they count as 2 trips.With data from bus trip in, they will adjust the next day as 1 trip.|Im not the one that set the transfer times anyways, but I think its to prevent people from deliberately tapping out, walking to the next station, tapping back in to save a dollar|the only response i can give to that is 'yeah, and?' because it's still arbitrary. in both cases the train still comes, stops at this station, moves to that next station, and leaves. they're basically charging you just for exiting, in both cases.this would sound less stupid if the toilets were inside of the gantry rather than outside, but im also not the one who designs the stations nor the pricing.|Wah if this is the hack Im sure OYK is willing to use his MOH budget to subsidize this one weird trick to get people to walk more.|The 15-min train transfer rule was first & foremost due to DTL. It was first introduced for Bukit Panjang & Newton, then Tampines, for the tap out & tap in transfers, when the respective stages of DTL opened.Then subsequently end 2018 out-of-station transfers were added, main intended use case between Rochor & Jalan Besar to skip the city loop of DTL (cheaper distance fare & shorter commute time). This was also when train-bus-train transfers were allowed without additional rail boarding charge.So the main purpose is just for immediate transfers as part of the commute. Any other combination of stations is allowable, its up to the commuter which they think is meaningful and doable within the 15min.The 45min transfers involving buses would take into consideration walking time plus waiting times. Does that end up allowing more flexibility to run errands, etc. in between? Sure. But thats not the original purpose of the transfer timing anyhow.15min is as arbitrary as 45min, in that sense. But both would be timed mainly for the commute transfer, any other use one can derive from that is just extra flexibility not the main intention.So if you need the toilet urgently, you can always just change to a bus after to switch to the next train station. Slightly inconvenient perhaps, but the (flexible) option exists to continue as the same journey.|Yeah the toilets I wish it's inside. Sometimes the ride from east to West so long.|btw for elderly they definitely need more than 15 mins to walk sia when i accompany my grandparents its very slow one|I tested this theory.

I shouldnt be paying for 2 separate trips, or have fare rules changed again? Please enlighten me. I found so many errors over the past 2 months just doing a quick scroll through my history. So tiring to have to submit claims for them 1 by 1, but heres a PSA to all to please go through your transactions too.

We recruit exclusively on MyCareersFuture, with the exception of one or two LinkedIn ads here and there. What Ive noticed is that some job search sites like Jobsdb, jobs central etc actually copy and paste our ads onto their own sites (then try to call us and sell us ad space which we dont need)And of course since we dont have an account with them, we cant respond to those ads. So they end up becoming fake job ads We realised this early on when potential candidates would email us about their applications and we find out theyre not even on our list, and when we ask them they tell us they applied through a site that we dont even useUpdate: I was curious and went to Google search our orgs name and indeed. Indeed (pun intended) we have current MCF ads being reposted on Indeed and JobsDB. So yeah this is a current practice|They found out that Dyson Singapore posted a whole bunch of fake job listings, and used those stats to pretend that they're expanding. I'm not surprised if this is common practice in SG|If you are looking at mycareerfuture, that whole site is full of fake job ads for the sole purpose of showing MOM the job was advertised before EP application for a foreigner, so if the EP keep getting rejected, especially for an internal transfer, the job will keep appearing as they resubmit the EP application.By the time the company apply for the EP, they very much made up their mind and the job ads and sometimes even interviews are just to fulfill the legal requirements and wasting everyone's time.That said, sometimes the job is real and there is multiple headcounts, so the job is always open and hiring slowly. Or sometimes there is a need but the headcount keeps getting taken away so they cannot make an offer.Edit: Forgot to mention, now even job role change, including promotions of EP holders who are already here, require such fake job postings. No thanks MOM, you are not helping Singaporeans by wasting our time this way. Please stop already.|There are several reasons for such 'dummy' job ads. One, some companies have ""excess budget"", dunno where to spend, so spend on ads. Two, by putting ads, it gives investors or potential investors that the impression the company is growing. Of course these reasons may sound plausible though a bit ridiculous so take it with a pinch of salt.|>The same roles have been posted since last year (June 2024 onwards) and the more ridiculous thing is for some govt agencies these are temporary roles..I've worked at a govt related office for a year before, under a recruitment agency contract and unfortunately those govt temp roles are real, it's ridiculous. Office suport role. It was a 3 months extendable contract up to a year. At first, I was paid hourly rate (office hour job btw) before they changed to paying a fixed monthly salary (due to the progessive wage model thingy).They limited us to work there only for a year even though there's ongoing work and even though it would've been easier/more consistent if they could've just made the role permanent. But apparently the HQ got limited quota/budget. Still makes no sense to me that they would replace staff yearly for the sake of limited budget yet make perm staff (who already have so much workload) utilise their limited time to train a newbie staff on the same thing every year. Rinse and repeat.|i avoid sponsored job postings with over 100 applicants on linkedin. you will see the same job posting on linkedin 3 months later despite the supposed high demand for it. my friends have said these job postings are just for hr to hit internal KPI on how much demand the job has or the company is just farming resumes. and yes, MNCs already have a foreigner lined up for whatever job they're posting, regardless of how junior the position is.|At one place I worked, I discovered that the supervisor had a pattern of failing employees during their probation period. She would first try to persuade the person to resign on their own, and if they refused, she would proceed to fail them. The supervisor had a preference for hiring 'A' level temps who were waiting to go to university.One day, my very smart cousinwho had achieved 4 A's in the A-levels from a top junior college and was about to attend NUSjoined the team as well. The supervisor seemed to like her a lot, possibly because my cousin was young, highly capable, and only a temp worker earning a modest salary, posing no threat to her. This is how I came to realize that the supervisors consistently failed people during their probation periods, often encouraging them to resign voluntarily. This practice explained why they were constantly hiring new staff.|I used to work for a company where my manager (who is in charge of HR amongst other things), would tell me that I have to repost the mycareerfuture ads for two junior positions (one exec and one non-exec position) once the ads expire. She was very particular and insistent about it and said that the reason for doing that is because we are expanding. When I was there frankly, I didnt notice they expand much. But the turnover was very high (even historically, as I was told) and they would get creative with the job titles (which someone else in the company who has been there for some years told me: its the same job as XX, just that they changed the job title).|or maybe the turnover is so high cuz its a shit job|Yes many fake job ads. No response at all if you apply, even if first few to apply and meets all the requirements. Then you see it reposted again the next month even though there were 100 applicants the first time they posted.There are also job ads posted by companies bidding for government projects and using your resume just to submit for the tender. The job will only materialise in 6 months or more which by then they will post another ad for the actual recruitment. Very unethical.There is also one job portal that keeps re-posting the same ad even after the position has been filled as indicated on other portals and the company's website.|Should we start a list of those fake or ghost job ads to keep a concerned informed?|From my experience there are quite a lot of ghost jobs. Jobs that are listed but actually isn't hiring be it for various reasons. E.g show investors they are growing, they or the recruiter engage did not take down the listing after hiring, use the info from applicants to estimate market pay and experience etc.Unfortunately it's not illegal so more and more keep popping up and old ones never go down|These job ads could also represent pipelining for the future. These roles could be evergreen roles that the company tends to hire frequently, and having an influx of applicants allows the recruiting team to save time for when they need to actually hire.|are you talking about those that lead you to jobleads website that asks you to subscribe so that you can apply for the job? its ridiculous.|Today I just finished a job interview online by a Japanese company. Reputable one. Actually I already guessed beforehand this role should be a fake one. As in they already have an internal candidate waiting to be transferred from Tokyo hq to come here. Cos the mcf Job posting is only 14 days. And no other platforms have this. And the salary range for this role is unusually high. But I went to just practise but hahah quite bad in japanese level for interview level (aka business japanese).|Ultimately depends on which site they're posted on. Places, like LikedIn and Indeed, are legit since companies must formally register themselves to create accounts.Whereas, other random sites, nobody has heard of, are very likely fake and just up to steal your data before selling it to whoever want it.But, posting on legit websites does not always mean companies are actually hiring since they're likely just collecting HR data to improve their hiring processes.You will know if the same positions are still up for more than a year.|Wow what|What a revealation|Thanks for sharing.

When a job post gets 3 or more postings consecutively for like 6 months or more or when it reappears shortly again it send these messages 1) fake job 2) fishing for salary to do your c&b benchmarking 3) this role is so shitty the turnover is skyrocket high|Ive noticed that for such advertisements, a clear giveaway is the above-market salary range, often double the typical amount that a local worker would earn.|I serve two fucking years for fuck|You mean promotions of EP holders they also advertise the higher job role on mcf???

Just wonder how to execute this idea The fake/ghost jobs are really super demoralising|Another type of ghost ads is when companies bid for government projects and use your resume as part of their tender submission. The job itself will only materialise in six months or later, and thats assuming the company wins the tender. In any case, by the time the project starts, they will post a new advertisement for actual recruitment rather than considering the applicants who initially applied.

You want ""basic respect"" for the activists, yet they did not show it for others. How can you speak of political maturity when you are talking about running ahead of needy residents to point the middle finger? Have you not noticed this sub is pretty left leaning from Singapore and anti-PAP? If that demographic is having a negative reaction, what more the rest of Singapore? Activists like these may have a genuine desire for change, but display the worst elements of the performative left - that it matters more to feel like they are doing something, it matters more to take a stand, to ""resist at all costs"" instead of striving for pragmatic change and progress. People can disagree with their cause without making personal attacks on their character? People can make points without pointing the middle finger and being disruptive assholes. Why is only one side allowed to be rude? But most importantly, was their protest productive, or counter productive? Did it help advance any of the causes they purported to, or did it end up making leftists like them look bad?

The result is that the MP - rightly - will conclude that there is a large scale low-effort campaign going on and that the letter writers do not care enough about the topic to actually devote time and effort to following through. All MPs - including the Workers Party - already understand that there are ongoing attempts to influence the political discourse and that not all these attempts are bona fide. In contrast, actual widespread authentic letter writing will lead to attention being paid because they come from a genuine groundswell.All this will do is get the PAP to pay more attention on how to refute the organisers, instead of how to y'know, *actually fix the problem*. Of course, some organisers would prefer that - you cannot advocate for a cause of the cause is removed.Please, do not learn how to do advocacy from the Anglo countries. They were always shit at it, especially because they have rarely tried to take a system-wide view of everything.|But how does a 10,000 street protest on Gaza achieve that? It's just noise|>(a) wider and more diverse channels of information flows to government, making policy and regulation better informed about public needs and opinions; and (b) greater legitimacy and trust from the public; and separately*looks at the US*I, er, dunno about that|You know what else is large scale and low effort? Voting. And are those votes a ""genuine groundswell""? Of course not, politicians spend a ton effort and money encouraging people to vote for them. A small group of campaigners pushing a large number of people into taking a low effort action is literally how elections are won or lost. Politicians dismiss this at their peril. At the end of the day the vote of someone who puts zero thought into it and only votes because their friend pushed them to, counts exactly the same as someone who thought deeply about it and voted of their own initiative. Given that very few will be in the latter cateogry, the former has a much bigger impact. >All this will do is get the PAP to pay more attention on how to refute the organisers, instead of how to y'know, *actually fix the problem*.As if they will ever fix the problem just because a few people write long winded essays to them. In democratic politics power comes from quantity not quality, and that means you need organisation to get things done.|Have you ever been involved in or attended a 10,000 person protest? Theres a lot more to it than a lot of people walking down the street, and noise. Think of a march like that as being a clear signifier to the govt and to each other that there is a large, mobilized, organized and motivated group of citizens on an issue (Gaza or otherwise). MPs that want to get re-elected tend to pay attention to such signals. Marches, rallies, in person public gatherings etc can provide powerful social norming, reinforcement and inspiration for their participants to undertake other forms of political engagement and persuasion - letter writing, visiting MPs, speaking to media, creating content for socials, getting hashtags trending nationally, doing terrible awkward street theatre.The G of course knows all this very well, which is precisely why such gatherings are not permitted here.|lolol true look at the rest of the OECD then|*roll eyes* okay bro, whatever you say, tell me the next time you win an election k?|>Have you ever been involved in or attended a 10,000 street protest?Nope, nor do I wish to. Keep that shit overseas.You're right, it's more than just noise. There's angry emotions stirred up. It divides the nation and becomes polarising. It can turn into harassment. I was watching this video of protestors shouting at a children's hospital for supporting genocide in Gaza.And what will be the outcome? Singapore won't change its stance of being in bed with Israel military.

They ensure that the ratio of electors to people electing them is kept the same, at around 17,000 to 30,000 people to 1 MP. This year, they identified that the biggest increases in population were Hong Kah North (due to the Tengah development area), Tampines, Sembawang and Potong Pasir. Thus, they decided to redraw those boundaries by adding more constituencies.The changes this year included the entire West and East being redrawn to accommodate the growing populations in both GRCs.

That is why its now called Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC. After adding a double barrel name, it makes perfect sense now.|[deleted]|To attract psp to contest there|WP can get a minimum of 35% in MacPherson. They won 33.6% in the SG50 election when there was a massive swing towards the PAP. A third candidate won less than 1%. This is the baseline in the worst case scenario. In this case, WP will need at least 53.9% in the rest of MP-BH to win the GRC. The voter numbers are in the EBRC report, you can do the math yourself.If WP can improve its vote share to 40% in MacPherson, then its winning threshold in the rest of MP-BH is lowered to 52.7%.|I think it was 25% for GMS. But yea, a quarter.TPL will see her vote share in Macpherson slashed , but with the winning margins razor thin (we could be looking at just thousands, or even hundreds, of votes), a more than 50% vote share for the PAP in Macpherson could tip the balance in their favour. Just to remember that Marine Parade shedded Joo Chiat (won by PAP but only hundreds of votes in 2011).|I dont disagree with you that it is here to stay, practically speaking.Id like to offer a different perspective - you raise whois it fair to, but a system can be objectively fair without concern to who. A fair measure of a well drawn boundary is that the popular vote number should correspond to the proportion of seats wins in parliament, with say a 10% margin difference. This indicator of fairness gives no heed to who it is.For example, the ruling party won approx 60% of the popular vote but won approx 90% of the parliamentary seats (excluding NCMP). Under this objective measure of fairness, the boundaries drawn by the EBRC in 2020 is counted as grossly unfair as there is a margin difference of 30%.|Funny thing is, my area used to be under Jurong GRC.

How would town council management work if a GRCs seats are split among multiple parties?","the absolute state of the ebrc report As Singapore gears up for the upcoming SG60 celebrations, the government is geared up- in a different way. People are getting ready to go to the polls- the 2025 General Election. Previously, in the 2020 election, the PAP returned to Parliament with the second-lowest popular vote share since independence, while the Workers Party gained four new seats and was responsible for the highest opposition representation in Parliament since 1968. The three closest constituencies, East Coast, Marine Parade and West Coast, all came to within 10,000 votes. Now, with the Electoral Committee Boundaries Report for the upcoming election released, West Coast has been eviscerated. Marine Parade and East Coast has been watered down. Is this genuine or gerrymandering?The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee is a committee consisting of the Secretary of the Prime Minister, the CEO of HDB, the Land Authority head, the chief statistician of the Department of Statistics, and the Head of the Boundaries Department. Every election cycle, they convene to redraw and refresh Singapores electoral boundaries before the election to determine the electoral boundaries for use at future elections taking into account population shifts and new housing developments. They ensure that the ratio of electors to people electing them is kept the same, at around 17,000 to 30,000 people to 1 MP. This year, they identified that the biggest increases in population were Hong Kah North (due to the Tengah development area), Tampines, Sembawang and Potong Pasir. Thus, they decided to redraw those boundaries by adding more constituencies.The changes this year included the entire West and East being redrawn to accommodate the growing populations in both GRCs. Additionally, Pasir Ris-Punggol was split up to accommodate the growing population in the Punggol district.What does this spell for the opposition?The splitting up of Jurong GRC into four parts (like a turkey) may help canvass votes for the Peoples Action Party. As Jurong GRC got 75% of the votes last election cycle, the votes may help bring up the Wests overall vote share, as the PAP team at West Coast only got 51% of the votes. However, with Iswaran gone, the vote share had been projected to drop. With this boundary redrawn, the blow would be softened.The huge mess of electoral boundaries in the East made many netizens call foul. Marine Parade, a projected highly contested area, had been cut up into many parts, while still keeping its ward in Braddell Heights. It also absorbed MacPherson SMC as well as a few polling districts from Mountbatten SMC, leaving Marine Parade-Braddell Heights looking like the lizard at the corner of your bedroom. East Coast also absorbed some parts of the old Marine Parade GRC, namely Siglap and Chai Chee. Finally, the ward Kampong Chai Chees name makes sense. Firstly, the high vote share in MacPherson would help Marine Parades vote share increase as MacPherson got over 70% of the votes last election cycle. However, East Coast would instead be more competitive for the Workers Party presumably contesting there. Maybe they could finally win there?With many opposition parties already staking their claim in constituencies, here are some things to look out for. As Jalan Kayu has already been choped by at least three political parties, a huge upset may be on the horizon if one of them plays their cards right Additionally, West Coast-Jurong West or Bukit Gombak may be flipped by the opposition as most of the opposition candidates contesting in the West have been able to gain some ground in GE2020. Next, Marine Parade-Braddell Heights and East Coast may also be taken by the opposition. So, its up to your choice to decide. Who will cause the biggest upset in the election? Only time will tell.PS: Why is Sembawang GRC more west than Sembawang West SMC?",0.22626119461059568,positive,0.04568964090347288,neutral

Get a big name in to secure up to 6 seats and the opposition will struggle to even hit 40% because they're a bunch of no name guys with little to their name. Then WP won Aljunied in 2011, kept it in 2015 and 2020 then added Sengkang. In the process they unseated George Yeo, delayed OYK's entry into Parliament while also removing Lam Pin Min and Ng Chee Meng from office.

And this was from an MRT station to the actual building it was meant to serve.Even the new TEL line has entrances on the backside from literally everywhere you actually want to get to, and gardens between the shortest path from there to the entrance (which are now getting trampled and smashed.)I actually thought about building a tool to prove this to the government using random points and measuring the ratio between straight line and walking directions to show the government how bad it is.Otherwise, great country.|No you are wrong, the right side is for people since theres stairs, center is for bicycle or motor users, and left is anyone with common sense to not walk on the long path.|it is just natural behaviour to take the most direct path. The sloped path isnt designed for those walking but wheeled movement and to slow it down|It's called a desire path!|r/desirepath|Because its the shortest, most direct path and with shelter no less. Unless no choice like in a wheelchair.|Path of least resistance.|Some of the newer HDB estates, I swear, are designed by absolute fuckwits. There is no straight path through the estates, in the most obvious manner. All meandering shit. Sometimes you just meander into a fucking dead end and have to retrace your steps to find how to get to the next block. Sheltered walkways are worse. Imagine a square where you can just walk from point A to point D, but NO, they design the shelter to make you go ABCD, with no shelter between A and D directly. During a recent thunderstorm I had to friggin navigate through two entire fucking estates because of their stupid zig-zag / no-shelter-at-this-place design, with fucking slopes for no good reason and slippery floors. If youre on a wheelchair, good luck to you. The designers fucking hate you.|Cause shortcut|Can wheelchair go on the drain cover?|and the shelter is useless. cover halfway, then youre on your own|Pls use brain.|Im the type who will take the blue path because 1) Shorter and direct path 2) More shade from the merciless |the shelter only goes straight|The same reason people cut across grass patch. The shortest path is often preferred.|Live dangerously /s|My hat off for civic mindedness, but: As if these discussions will lead to action |![gif](giphy|hpAMh2sBYpsmFhSRPI)|r/DesirePath|is this next to guangyang sec? haha in my time i also used to walk down the grass cos its way shorter|There's a whole subreddit for this behaviour. It's called r/desirepath|r/mildlyinfuriating|Its's really designed so that someday a minister can come and PARKOUR! over the railing to show how connected they are to the youth /s|OP, i can promise you the **professionals** who are involved in this project took a least a few months to do a thorough investigation of the site before building this.Often times, there are things that cannot be understood by laymen like building codes, compliance for different authorities, existing drainage system, underground services, soil condition, budget, timeline...etc which greatly affect the design outcome of the covered linkways.|r/DesirePath|Every grass with trait tell a story of a failed design.It's everywhere.|Most of the things designed in Singapore do not consider user perspective. Mostly designed with cost in mind and not usability.|r/assholedesign|hmmm, i think you ought to send a feedback to LTA about this and disturb them. the shelter should be following the ramp. The ramp cannot go straight down because of limits on how steep it can be. As someone who did LTA projects before (including this kind of sheltered walkways), this is a c\*ck-up.|Phone zombies walk in a straight line. It's more convenient|Pakour is invented because being normal is weak.|Brainless|Is there a better way to create a straight wheelchair path?|In addition those people who design pathways are idiots mostly. In my estate lots of shortcuts taken by people. Instead of using paths simply because the paths were really a k ward and don't offer shortest path from A to B.It literally took years for most paths to be relaid.|Actually the reason why you have these kind of things is because there is no designer involved.|Your picture tells a thousand words. The shadows answer your question.You also can't always blame on the designer, always blame the supervisor and the boss first.|Desire lines! It's a matter of time that grass patch turns bald if it wasn't for the railings|I'm guessing the shelter was ""ordered"" and built first. Then later came laws or pressure to be handicapped accessible, and the ramp was built later, by a contractor who knows that the slope cannot be too steep. And the original walkway was converted back into grass. The original shelter contractor had no idea of the considerations involved in planning a handicapped accessible ramp. The ramp contractor's scope of work did not include shifting the shelter.|Architect already gave notice and scribbled some plans. Workers not paid enough to care about misalignment and the person who signed off on the project did not do inspection. While people like OP who raise complaints are dismissed and mocked as seen by the comments here...|I agree. If you don't want people to take the blue path, you should make it more difficult to walk on so it's less desired|And its sheltered all the way|Yes. The gradient can't be too steep for wheelchair users or it will be dangerous.|Why need gentle slope? Just let them enjoy roller coaster speed /s|Cutting across the track to gain an advantage. 5 sec time penalty.|Oh man, walked down this path for 4 years some 6 years ago, that shelter was not there, nor was this pathway I think. All my classmates and I just walked down the slope on the drain. It was either that or a staircase with occasional flats.|Yes|Lmao I love how every part of SG can be instantly recognisable to someone.|A comment that makes sense and deserves an upvote.|His ego is too inflated, could never see beyond his own needs. People with mobility issues are not of his concern |Right? If it was pouring the ""proper"" path will be at least half rain|This! Every estate. I can find desire paths everywhere! Even new estates which to me, by new standards of walkability, doesn't sound world-class to me.|Fuck yeah, I'm at sengkang fernvale and I swear the rain shelter is designed by fuckwits. It's so much longer, and you will still get wet.|calm down|Cars get the straight lines, pedestrians get shafted. Not only Sengkang, any new BTO that is prefab is designed like this.|Cause I say so|You cant fight the terrain. The slope has to be of a safe gradient which is spelt out in code of practice.|gradient must comply to Accessibility code, most of the time no.|This guy understands public infrastructure|OP can oneservice this concern, right ? Esp with upcoming election |As an architect who has experience in sheltered linkway projects, I'd say bless you. Can just pin your comment and then close the thread The only thing to add on is that, the project probably wasn't given enough budget and time to scrap and rebuild a new shelter.|Recently at my parents' place, they re-did the ramp at the loading unloading bay. It used to be that there used to be a short ramp directly into the bay. They sealed that up, and created an L shaped ramp that leads to the the small road NEXT to the loading unloading bay. So now anytime I'm pushing a trolley down the new ramp, I have to push the trolly on the small 2 lane road (no pedestrian path) to get to the loading unloading bay. It's retarded and unsafe.|Yeah look at the sun. I'd walk in the shade instead of such direct sun|I tot your argument was right, until I looked at google map images. Turns out the ramp was there all along, the shelter was a later addition!!|Also to prevent cyclists from zooming reckless down the path, or if you're pushing a stroller/wheelchair and accidentally lose control, it doesn't go straight into the path of cars.|![gif](giphy|cPHfmeNVxTEiRhVluo)|I've been walking this path for 15 years now ever since the start of Sec 1 to get the my sch in TPY area, usually I'll just walk through the indoor carpark cos I know I won't be able to maintain my balance while walking on the slope|And thick written regulations and the lack of desire to argue with their enforcers.|It's getting annoying to hear people bring up election for everything. OneService is the platform that always delivers, election or not.|I looked at google map images and Turns out the ramp was there all along, the shelter was a later addition!! Seems like people who approved the shelter did a half assed job|depends on what district you live in|I recognise this! It's bishan, right? Both the shelter and the pathway were approximately the same time. It was just blocked off until the entire thing was done iirc. There was a different path before this I think..? I remember biking down the dirt on the far left before this|I saw your other comment that it's near guangyang sec and saw just the ramp. My theory for the shelter being design this way is that the shelter columns cannot be placed near a certain distance from the **existing drainage** (under PUB).Any other design may cause a budget or timeline issue.|Definitely not the GRC in the north that SDP is intending to 3-corner in.|I searched guangyang sec then select street view and it appeared|seems like Bishan Toa Payoh Town Council is quite incompetent in approving shelter design. the sheltered pathway recently completed at my estate has a small unsheltered gap between 2 blocks where someone with common sense could have taken a look at the design drawings and go hmm if we are creating a shelter already why not extend the shelter a little bit more so that we cover all trafficked paths a resident may take.|Google maps, search guangyang sec, street view, then turn right. According to images from Mar 2022 and jun 2021, the ramp is unchanged, and shelter not erected yet. Its a very illogical build for the shelter, its bugging me as well|yeah I want to know the purpose of this shelter (where it leads to etc) but unfortunately, i can't see from this image. Whichever director or management in-charge of this project should pump in more $$$ to ensure a bigger cantilever shelter can be placed there to avoid all structural problems caused by the existing drainage.",Why do most people walk on the drain cover instead of the path? Did the designer even consider user behavior? nan,-0.3766784965991974,negative,0.8477114577293396,positive
