You may ask, what 'needs' do intellectually gifted (not high ability) students need? For one, intellectually gifted (gifted hereafter) students find every aspect of the normal curriculum extremely simple. Their 'needs' refer to the need of intellectual stimulation beyond the range of peers at their age. For example, gifted kids at P3 can already be learning about A-level Science concepts at their own free time. You might also ask about the difference between a gifted student and a high ability (HA hereafter) student. Gifted students are literally years ahead compared to their peers. These gifted students make up only 1% of the student cohort ^(\^1) ([source]( HA students make up around 7% of the student population^(\^1) ([source]( clear distinction between the gifted and HA students are also apparent in class. HA students tend to get bored in class as well, but they are not infallible and still tend to have many learning gaps. Gifted students get bored in class, mostly because they really know and understand everything in the normal curriculum.>**The goals of the GEP are to:**>Develop intellectual depth and higher level thinking.>Nurture productive creativity.>Develop attitudes for self-directed lifelong learning.>Enhance aspirations for individual excellence and fulfilment.>Develop a strong social conscience and commitment to serve society and the nation.>Develop moral values and qualities for responsible leadership.The GEP programme was literally started to meet the increased intellectual needs of 1% of our population, to allow them to achieve their potential. If current MOE leaders can't tell the difference between a gifted child and a HA child, they're really being deliberately disingenuous. **Why is the GEP curriculum special?**Based on [MOE's website]( the GEP curriculum covers more advanced topics, goes deeper and provides for collaboration with tertiary institutions.They are also able to embark on [Individualised Study Options (ISOs)]( where they do real research through special programmes.**How are students selected?**Based on [MOE's website]( there are 2 stages: 1. Screening test (EL and Math)2. Selection test (EL, Math and General Ability)Students who pass both tests will be posted to a GEP school where they will be put in a GEP class (of 20-30(?)) students who will undergo a *specialized GEP* curriculum. # Why has the GEP programme been abolished?From the press release [^(1)]( the goal of this abolishment was to:* Broaden opportunities for pupils (benefit more pupils)* Move away from assessing them by a single yardstick (GEP selection)**How will it work?**Based on a [press release]( Screening test at P3 will be kept, while the second stage (selection test) will be dropped. 2. Students who are selected will take part in school-based programmes (E2K Science/Math, EL writing or debate).3. Students will have multiple opportunities to join these school-based programmes from P4-P6.4. ""GEP"" students have opportunities to go to other schools for after-school programmes.**These school-based programmes have already been targeting HA students for the past 20-30 years**The only observable change is that instead of a single selection process at the end of P3, now students can get assessed every year to join these programmes. Touting the new approach as: >""largely similar"" to the current programmes for higher-ability learners and the current GEP programmeIs extremely disingenuous as after-school programmes that run for 1 hour each week are nowhere close to the goals or execution of the GEP curriculum. The existing after-school programmes will just be expanded to accommodate 10% (up from 7%) of students to benefit more students, while the first GEP selection test will still be carried out.# Why is this a problem?Gifted students are now forced to undergo the same standard curriculum that bores them to the core, disallowing them from actually reaching their potential. If that wasn't bad enough, guess what bored students do? They find ways to entertain themselves. Some might be self sufficient in their entertainment, while others act up in ways that would hinder the learning of the other 39 students in the class. Recently, the Primary school syllabus has also changed. It has become more open-ended and self-exploratory due to the buzzword ""hollistic"" 5-10 years ago when they started planning it. The concepts have also been getting more and more complex and packed, lessening the time available to learn each concept. Teachers are now more of facilitators, and facilitating the self-exploration and inquiry of 40 students is extremely impossible given the packed curriculum. You just can't cover every student with the time you have.Note that none of what I've said above would be too much of a problem for a gifted student. They'd still be snacking on the standard curriculum like a bag of chips. Now in a class of 40 students, the gifted student would not get enough mental stimulation and get bored (and maybe act out). Or the teacher could engage the gifted students while the rest of the students get bored because it's out of their depth and act out. It's already difficult to engage HA students with the normal curriculum, much less a gifted one. Of course it's not an absolute, but you'd get the idea. **MOE has admitted that there may be **[**some reduction**]( in the intensity of enrichment as compared to the current GEP**>higher-ability learners will be adequately engaged and hoslistically developed through school-based programmes.So consequently, they won't be ""adequately engaged"" and ""hollistically developed"" through the standard curriculum. This dumbed down revamp is basically the *removal of the GEP programme*. **There will still be better schools with regards to ""GEP"" even though there aren't any GEP schools anymore**The current GEP schools would have the resources and specially trained teachers to beef up whatever after-school programmes they already had, but non-GEP schools will not have specially trained GEP teachers nor the years of experience and resources available. **The GEP programme wasn't only about academics**Former [GEP ]( ([both ]( [reddit ]( news articles) have [attested ]( a [few ]( Smaller class size - As much as OYK wants to cherrypick studies that show increased class sizes don't help, they do.

Secondly, MOE is refusing to admit that the top 1% of gifted children are not the same as the 7% of HA students. The problem isn't about having suitable after-school programmes, because schools have had these programmes for years. The issue is with teachers being able to engage these gifted children in a class of 39 while executing the standard (boring and intellectually limiting) curriculum.The idea of inclusivity in the past decade has resulted in each class having more and more children with behavioral needs. Even when a child starts hurting other classmates, teachers' hands are tied because the schools will not dish out any proper consequence. Some primary school students have learning disabilities (can't even read or write or speak English at P6 level), but are still allowed to stay in mainstream schools. Teachers are already stretched thin, trying to juggle the increased amount of discipline issues brought about by these ""inclusivity"" outliers, and now they have to grapple with the prospect of having gifted kids who might act out in boredom, or go for hours of extra training courses.Without having time to even plan for lessons nowadays (due to nonsensical admin work), this might just be the final nail in the coffin for many teachers. (Hearsay, don't POFMA), that many teachers have left service in the recent years. Some schools are running skeleton crews with flexi-adjuncts making up as much as 20% of the teacher population.

Too critical? Too little bootlicking? I'll let you decide.---As an urban planning enthusiast, I have been following with keen interest Singapore's car-lite plans in recent years. I was heartened to read about developments such as car-lite towns (e.g. Tengah), or [the planned expansion of Singapore's cycling path network to 1,300km by 2030]( yet ultimately disappointed at their implementations. It seems that despite the many proclamations of going car-lite, Singapore is only taking half-hearted measures of limited effectiveness.To be clear, going car-lite is not a novel ambition for a city to pursue. Cities all around the world have taken massive steps towards reducing their reliance on cars. For instance, [New York City]( has converted car lanes in many of its arterial downtown avenues into protected bike and bus lanes. [Paris]( closed down major roads, converting them to bike highways, and removed >70% of parking spaces to accommodate cyclists - both growing cycling traffic and reducing car ownership significantly. San Francisco, Oslo, Copenhagen, and many more other cities are taking similar steps to reduce car usage and promote walking, cycling, and public transit.In all these case studies, a common theme is redesigning physical infrastructure to be less car centric.Yet, in Singapore, this aspect has been neglected. Singapore's physical infrastructure remains steadfastly car-centric. Most of the new bike lanes I see are not reclaiming space from cars, but from pedestrians. What used to be a wider pavement has been split down the middle, to be shared by both pedestrians and cyclists. Meanwhile, the wide roads for cars remain untouched. This is true even in supposedly car-lite Tengah.The most glaring example of unjustifiable car-centric design is in Singapore's downtown CBD - Singapore's most walkable, transit-dense, and connected region. In the area with arguably the least need to drive, [Robinson Road]( features 5 wide lanes for vehicles but narrow pavements for humans to share. Singapore's CBD bike lane network consists of painted lines on pavements, while the wide, 5-6 lanes of road space are seemingly and inexplicably protected and untouchable.It is hardly surprising then that car owners are reluctant to give up driving, because Singapore's infrastructure and policies continually reinforce the car as the superior mode of transportation. All the painted bike lanes and reclaimed pavements will hardly make a dent in changing travel patterns, as long as the car remains at the top of the hierarchy.True car-lite cities in the world do not need COEs to forcibly cap car ownership rates. Instead, car-liteness is achieved when policies and infrastructure prioritize non-car modes of travel such that people naturally opt out of driving.

In the past 48 hours there have been several posts regarding Singapore's economy, population growth, foreign workers, public transport, housing prices, low birthrates high deathrates etc. I've been here long enough to know how the comments were going to play out: Negative tone, saying that our government has really pushed for an unsustainable population and economic growth above all else, how the PAP has lost its ways, how we're all just cogs in this machine, how we should leave this place if we have the chance etc etc. I've reached the point where I no longer read these comments and just filter them out because I feel they ruin my mood. But the thing that has been bugging me is: These comments aren't inherently wrong. The facts and figures don't lie, people are just reacting to them online because that's the only thing they can do.As far as I know, every country in the world wants an increasing population and a soaring economy. Every country that has negative growth and a declining population always view it as a very bad problem. More people=More money. Who doesn't want that? So we've hit 6 million people, and Redditporeans say that's too many. But what exactly can we do? We need the foreign workers to work the jobs Singaporeans don't want to do, we need the immigrants to supplement the low birthrate, and we can't fix the low birthrate fast enough because our ""competitive, companies first, workers second"" stance is why the companies even came here in the first place (this one might be my own bias). The only ""real"" solution that I can see, is that Singapore lets our economy slow down, let growth drop and implement reforms that make life better for Singaporeans, everything that Redditporeans say that want to see. 4 day work week, popping that housing bubble, WFH if possible, slashing immigration rates. Companies start leaving because they don't want to reform, the population starts to drop as the jobs aren't there anymore, and the Singaporeans become happier. This comes at the expense to our economy and our global competitiveness. I don't know how bad this scenario will be, or if it's even a bad thing at all, but I've got a feeling that there is some horrible caveat to this that I haven't been able to figure out. Redditporeans love to comment that the 1990s was the best time for Singapore, until the government decided to accelerate immigration and economic growth, at the expense to our people, the housing infrastructure and the transport infrastructure.

t3_1g7yv3h,Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System,"In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones. This approach is creating significant issues, particularly when people have their eyes on a specific project but are forced to consider other projects within the same estate. For example, the recent BTO launch includes 3 bundled Bedok projects (2 Bayshore sites and 1 Kembangan site) and 3 bundled Kallang/Whampoa sites (1 Lavender site, 1 Whampoa site, 1 Upper Boon Keng site). Applicants do not have the option to ballot for a single site; they must enter the ballot for all sites in the same bundle.# 1. ""Forced to Choose"" to avoid New Penalty RulesOne of the primary issues is that applicants aiming for a specific project are automatically entered into a ballot for every project in the estate. If they fail to get a favorable queue number for their desired project, they may be forced to choose from other projects that they may have no real interest in. Otherwise, theyll have to face a one-year wait-out penalty where they are barred from balloting again.This creates an undesirable situation where applicants must either settle for a less appealing project just to avoid the penalty, or be locked out of the system for a year. Its not just about getting lucky in the current state, even ""average luck"" wont suffice if applicants are aiming for highly sought-after projects. Let's look at the current BTO exercise as an example: those who are interested in Crawford Heights (prime location with only 234 4R units) are currently competing with 1,880 other applicants, meaning only about the top 15% will secure a unit at Crawford Heights, while the rest must choose between the other two projects (Towner Breeze and Kallang View) or face the one-year penalty. Now this used to be less of an issue in previous exercises where projects were bundled together as an estate. For example October 2023's Kallang/Whampoa BTO launch also had 3 different sites bundled together, and while one is a PLH, the other two are standard flats with 5 year MOP. If applicants were not able to select their desired PLH flat, they could still choose either of the standard flats and only serve a 5-year MOP. This provided applicants with a valuable safety net: if they could not secure their preferred PLH flat, they still had the option to select one of the standard flats and only commit to a 5-year MOP, allowing for greater flexibility in their housing decisions. Not to mention, these standard flats came with no restrictions, were still situated in prime areas, and held significant potential profit after just 5 years. Unfortunately, all Kallang/Whampoa projects in the current exercise are at least Plus flats, and have a 10 year MOP. This means that applicants could potentially be locked into a longer commitment in a home they might not genuinely want. Whether due to job relocations, changes in family size, or shifts in personal preferences, being tied to a property for such an extended period can severely limit options.**2. Pitfalls of Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)**The MCPS is designed to encourage applicants to live near their parents by granting them an extra ballot chance for projects located close to their parents' homes. However, in large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, the geographic spread of available projects can be quite vast. This creates a situation where people aiming for a specific project near their parents may find themselves instead needing to consider another project that is far from them.Moreover, applicants can apply for this scheme as long as at least one of the units bundled together is near their parents, thereby birthing a potential loophole in this scheme whereby applicants can use their proximity advantage to gain a better chance for a project that is not actually near their parents. For instance, someone who qualifies for the scheme because their parents live near Project A could use that extra ballot chance to select a unit in Project B, even if Project B is far from their parents (assuming both Project A and B are lumped into the same estate). This undermines the original purpose of the scheme, which is meant to facilitate closer family living, not provide an unfair advantage for unrelated projects.**3. Neglecting Locational Differences and Individual Needs** Lumping multiple projects into a single estate-wide ballot fails to account for both the geographical spread and applicants' individual preferences. In large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, projects can be located far apart, making it unfair to treat them as one choice. Applicants aiming for a specific location may end up balloting for projects that are not as conveniently located. This approach also disregards varied personal prioritieswhether it's proximity to work, family, or access to amenitiesreducing the process to simply securing a unit, rather than finding a home that meets their specific needs. In light of these issues, one must wonder why HDB continue to implement this bundled ballot system. While the intention may be to streamline the application process and increase efficiency, it raises serious concerns about fairness and the ability of Singaporeans to secure homes that genuinely meet their needs. As the housing landscape evolves, it is essential for HDB to consider these implications and adapt its approach to better serve the diverse needs of its BTO applicants.",Housing,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.993,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7yv3h/exposing_a_huge_flaw_in_the_current_bto_balloting/,Reddit,10/20/24 13:36,"Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones.

t3_1gd1qae,Ask me anything lanesplitting,"Seen so many misunderstandings about lane splitting so i think its time ppl understand how it works. Issue with sg is that there r way too many cars compared to motorcycles so majority wont understand motorcycle issues. Yall can ask ur questions n me n other riders can answer it. I hope most ppl actually read this b4 i see another post on lane splitting. Ill try to explain some common points n yall can add/ask more.1) Lane splitting is illegal. No its not illegal, TP,LTA n other enforcement uses it so its ofc not illegal. Driving schools will tell u its a grey area so u do it at ur discretion (smthg like discretionary right turn)2) Ban lane splitting. If u think the current traffic isnt bad enough n u want even longer traffic sure go suggest to ur MP. Personally i feel like if someone can benefit from the space, why not. Just because i am stuck in jam doesnt mean everyone has to get stuck in jam. Thats just resentment.3) Lane splitting is not safe. Yes n No. The main issue with lane splitting is that it was never taught properly so for most riders its monkey see monkey do. This makes it very dangerous especially for newer riders(no experience) n older riders (no reflex). Once u have ridden for a certain no. Of years there will be rules u make (dont go too fast, only lane split between lane 1 n 2, keep a distance from the front, inch out b4 merging into lane splitting lane etc.)4) why is lane splitting safer? Motorcycles (smaller cc) have weaker braking power than cars so if there happens to be an accident/ebrake (common in sg), they cant avoid it. Why not go at a safe distance? Well if u drive in sg, a safe distance equals to impatient ppl cutting u off which makes it more dangerous. Also being able to see whats in front makes it much safer. Imagine driving in between 2 trucks vs driving between 2 cars.5) why do most riders lane split recklessly? Well like i said this is because it wasnt taught properly n maybe they r influenced by out JB riders which do it regularly. Malaysia has a higher presence of motorcycles which makes their drivers more careful hence they can be more reckless.6) Why do riders cut queue? Because they lane split to the front, it doesnt make sense to stay in the lane splitting lane when static as they r in the blindspot of the vehicles. They also put other riders at the back in danger as not all vehicles will move off straight. Usually most riders dont play phone n motorcycles have better pickup than cars so most will zoom off after green causing not much invonvenience. From my experience, i usually will cross the junction b4 the first car starts moving.Extra: Lane splitting is also dangerous due to drivers mentality in sg. Most dont signal n check blindspot when changing lanes. They also do the swerve lane change instead of gradual lane change. Another issue is lane sharing, drivers can give more space to make lane splitting more smoother (right lane stay more to the right n left lane stay more to the left) but most dont.In summary it can be safe/graceful if drivers n riders understand each other but in sg when everyone is selfish/entitled otr this issue will most likely stay till the future.",Transport,-0.6,0.8,0.6,-0.4808,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1gd1qae/ask_me_anything_lanesplitting/,Reddit,10/27/24 3:06,"Ask me anything lanesplitting Seen so many misunderstandings about lane splitting so i think its time ppl understand how it works.

As I reflect on the developments, I realize that the perception of NRIC secrecy has undergone significant changes over the years.**Background: The Shifting Landscape of NRIC Secrecy**Growing up in the 90s, I recall that NRIC numbers were not as heavily guarded as they are today. As a class/ CCA representative, I had access to a list of my classmates' unmasked NRIC numbers to take attendance. However, even then, there is a perception on the privacy of NRIC. I recall my grandparents and parents always cautioned me against sharing my NRIC number, citing the risk of loan sharks.**The PDPA and the Masking of NRIC**With the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the subsequent masking of NRIC numbers around 2019, the government emphasized the importance of protecting personal data. This move reinforced the notion that NRIC numbers are sensitive information to the general public.**Observations and Concerns**Despite the government's efforts to protect NRIC numbers, several observations raise concerns about the effectiveness of these measures:1. *Widespread distribution of NRIC numbers:* Prior to the PDPA and masking of NRIC numbers, these numbers were freely distributed, making it likely that they can still be found on older documents.2. *Formula of NRIC numbers:* The structure of NRIC numbers includes 'S' for those born before 2000 and 'T' for those born on or after 2000. The first two digits indicate the birth year (for the majority), and the next five digits represent the time of registration. This, coupled with the fact that the alphabet in NRIC numbers follows a fixed formula, makes it relatively easy to approximate a person's NRIC number, especially when combined with the last three digits and the alphabet.3. *NRIC numbers used for authentication:* Currently they are widely used as authentication details for government agencies and banks.4. *Public perception of NRIC secrecy:* The majority of Singaporeans view their NRIC numbers as secret and private information, often using them as passwords or for other private purposes.**The Dissonance Between Perception and Reality**These observations highlight a clear dissonance between the public's perception of NRIC secrecy and the reality of its vulnerability. This disconnect creates a false sense of comfort, which may lead to increased data theft.**Complications Arising from the New Regulation**The government's decision to move away from masking NRIC numbers raises several complications:1. *New authentication details:* The number one concern for everyone will be: what will the new authentication details be? Should the entire authentication process be revamped? The truth is, most authentication details (e.g., date of birth, address, mother's maiden name, etc.) are not exactly private information, but they are not public either. Using a sufficient number of data points should create a certain comfort level to take specific actions. These thresholds should definitely be set by the government with clear guidelines.2. *Balancing transparency and security :* While NRIC numbers may not be entirely private, making them publicly available may not be necessary or beneficial. In this regard, I am unable to understand the enhanced trust and transparency mentioned by the Government.**Conclusion**In conclusion, while reducing reliance on NRIC numbers as private information may be a positive step, it is essential to address the deeply ingrained perception of NRIC secrecy in the population. The government must clearly communicate the rationale and implications of the new regulation, ensuring a smooth transition and alleviating public concerns.**Side Notes**1. *Government communication :* The government's communication on this issue has been piecemeal and incoherent, leaving many wondering about the details particularly the intention of this new move.2. *Inter-agency coordination:* The lack of coordination between government agencies, as evident in the ACRA incident, highlights the need for improved communication and alignment.",Legal,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9963,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hgr3qh/my_view_on_the_whole_nric_saga/,Reddit,12/18/24 2:03,"My view on the whole NRIC saga **The Evolution of NRIC Secrecy in Singapore**The recent controversy surrounding the new NRIC regulation has sparked intense debate.

t3_1ho0vvl,Need advice on contesting Non-Accidental Injury assessment by doctors,"Dear Reddit,I am a Singaporean parent of 2 children and am desperate for some help or advice.My younger child (1 year old) fell down and injured her right arm. When we went to the hospital, the doctor classified it as a non-accidental injury (NAI), filed a police report against me and my spouse. We are feeling so shocked and frustrated because the hospitals treated us like child abusers without listening to our explanations and refused to discharge us until we signed documents to acknowledge that we caused a non-accidental injury. Because we were so tired, we just signed those documents to go home to sleep, and now we are regretting it.The injury was definitely not caused by us, and we think that it was instead caused by other doctors. I wanted to share our (long) story here to see if anyone has any medical or non-medical advice, perspectives or experiences to share.The background is that my family (me, my spouse, older child, younger child) went for holiday. On the flight, my younger child fell from the airplane seat. We didnt think much about it until 2 hrs later, when we realised that her arm was limp and she could not use it. We called for on-board medical assistance, and thankfully a pediatrician was on board. The pediatrician assessed the arm and the preliminary assessment was a dislocated elbow. She performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place but it did not seem successful. So the pediatrician suggested we go to a hospital immediately upon landing.The airline was kind and arranged for an emergency ambulance to pick us up from the airplane and go straight to the hospital. At the hospital, an x-ray was taken and the doctor said that there was no fracture so it should be a dislocated or pulled elbow and performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place. After the maneuver, the doctors took another x-ray to check that the elbow was fixed, and put her arm in a cast. We continued our holiday for 7 days, growing more and more worried as my child did not regain the usage of her hand.After flying back to Singapore, we immediately went to a hospital A&E to seek a second opinion and assess whether the injury was wrongly diagnosed in the foreign country. The A&E doctor took an x-ray and performed a closed reduction maneuver three times. However this was not successful, so it was referred to Orthopaedics. After waiting for a long while, the Orthopaedic doctor came by and asked many questions about how the injury came about. We had to take time to explain the whole background above while my child was still crying, and so we asked the doctor for his diagnosis and for treatment to be administered quickly as my child was in pain. The Orthopaedic doctor said that it could be a serious injury and that surgery under GA was needed. We were very surprised and initially did not want to agree to GA because our child is only one year old and there were risks. This doctor explained that this is the only way to fix the arm and if surgery is not done as soon as possible, there is risk of permanent deformation of the arm. As parents, when you hear an explanation like that, of course we agreed to the surgery.After the surgery, the doctors said that the operation went well and my child was warded for observation. While warded, we kept asking for details of the injury and a timeline for discharge but no one could give us a clear answer. Two days after the surgery, we received a call from the police saying that a police report had been made against us for non-accidental injury of our child and they needed to investigate because our account was inconsistent with the injury. I felt that this was ridiculous because the doctors had not even explained what injury my child had. After multiple requests for the medical report, the doctors finally told us that the injury was a right distal humerus physeal separation fracture.The doctors explained that it is impossible for such an injury to happen from a fall, as it would require such force if we were to swing our child from the arms. We explained that we definitely did not do such actions, and to us, it seemed more likely that the multiple doctors (on board the plane, the doctor in the foreign country, the A&E doctor) would have caused the fracture. The doctors dismissed our explanations, and insisted that they cannot discharge us until the investigations were complete.To make things worse, they required one parent to be with the child at all times, but refused to allow my older child into the ward. Hence, our family lived apart for five days which was the longest we had ever been separated. On the fifth day after the surgery, two documents (voluntary care agreement and safety plan) were presented to us stating that we as parents could have caused the non-accidental injury. The doctors said that we can be discharged if we sign the two documents, so of course we agreed to go home to see our kids, unpack from our overseas trip and rest properly in a bed.I used to believe that if youve done nothing wrong, youve got nothing to fear. However, after this incident, I realised that even in Singapore, if youve done nothing wrong, you do have something to fear. After going home and resting, we regretted signing those documents. We love our children so much and would never hurt them, but now we admitted guilt of injuring our child in a non-accidental manner. The doctors can still accuse you and confine you in a hospital ward until you sign a confession.Is it there any way for us to contest the doctors assessment that it was a non-accidental injury in Singapore?

Ive always wondered but recently, I found time to write in to the town council and theyre like, this is under HDBs purview. Theres even a shed below the block containing some makeshift stuff thats apparently also under HDBs purview. What happened to no-wrong-door? Why was the common area cordoned off for years? Is it because it is a rental block where poor people live so HDB dont give a shit about them? No wonder some rich new citizens say HDBs are slums.Ive submitted a report through OneService.

t3_1iizpp4,Leong Mun Wai rebukes accusations of racism by Shanmugam on his Facebook page,"There He Goes Again Yesterday in Parliament, I had asked a PQ to clarify whether the Government is reviewing the CMIO model in view of what Minister Edwin Tong has said at a recent IPS Conference that the model should be constantly reviewed to reflect Singapores increasingly complex multicultural landscape. I thought this was a reasonable question. But I was caught unawares when Minister Shanmugam suddenly dredged up two old issues and used them to accuse me of racial discrimination. These old issues are already well-documented in the Hansard. I acknowledge that when I raised the CECA issue in Parliament in 2021, there will be some people who will think that there is a racial undertone to it. This is unfortunate, but I have clarified many times that CECA was only raised as a potential economic issue. The debate was necessary because we believe the employment data provided by the Government is insufficient to form a full picture of the employment situation facing Singaporeans. The second issue was about a previous Facebook comment on HDB flats which was unrelated to this issue. I wish to reiterate what I said in the House yesterday, which is that PSP supports the Ethnic Integration Policy. But PSP also notes that the EIP may have caused economic disadvantages to minority communities which need to be addressed. I was speaking to advance the concerns of minorities, and genuinely seeking to represent their interests as a Parliamentarian and fellow Singaporean. I hope that Ministers will not be quick to label Singaporeans as racist when we want to clarify a socio-economic issue even if it touches upon race. (This principle is particularly important because we have just passed the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill on Tuesday). I have brought up many such sensitive issues, such as the sentences given to the PRC citizens involved in the $3 billion money laundering case. I am even more disappointed because it is Minister Shanmugam, who had spent the same six years with me in Raffles Institution, who has been making such allegations against me. Although we were never close friends in school, through our many common friends in our cohort, he should have known me better. After I graduated from RI, I have lived almost continuously for two decades overseas and have cultivated friendships with many schoolmates, co-workers and even customers.

Please cycle as if the car driver has no idea you are there!",-0.9691699140071869,negative
t3_1ikipfy,Tan Cheng Bock criticises Shanmugam for affecting public perception on PSP,"Multi-racialism, National issues and Mature politicsSome days ago, Minister Shanmugam leveled several well publicized accusations against my party comrade Leong Mun Wai. As the Ministers words affect the publics perception on PSP, I thought I should reiterate what PSP stands for. 1) PSP stands for multi-racialism. Singaporeans from all races form our membership, CEC leadership and GRC candidate slate. Our Nee Soon GRC candidates in GE 2020 is a good example. We readily fielded Caucasian, Chinese, Malay and Indian candidates, and will continue to do so. We are a party where all races have a voice.2) PSP stands for national issues. We did not shy away from questioning the Government on sensitive topics like CECA and CMIO. On the surface, these subjects have racial elements. But they also affect the well-being and livelihood of every Singaporean. As such, we will continue to be fearless when speaking up in Parliament on national issues.3) Finally the PSP stands for mature politics. I hope the Minister will be slow to label Mun Wai or the PSP as racist just because of some isolated incident or statements. Isolated lapses affect all parties and we should careful not to go overboard with our comments especially when they concern the highly flammable issue of race. For instance, when a minority MP from the Ministers GRC vacated her seat mid-term without replacement, would it be fair to say that the PAP cares little for minority representation? One may be tempted to infer so but mature politics will suggest surely not. The same can be said about making unfair racist inferences based on the statements in this case.Lets do better. For multi racialism, for national issues and for mature politics. Because we do it For Country, and For People.Source: Tan Cheng Bocks Facebook",Politics,-0.6,0.75,0.6,0.9721,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ikipfy/tan_cheng_bock_criticises_shanmugam_for_affecting/,Reddit,2/8/25 8:25,"Tan Cheng Bock criticises Shanmugam for affecting public perception on PSP Multi-racialism, National issues and Mature politicsSome days ago, Minister Shanmugam leveled several well publicized accusations against my party comrade Leong Mun Wai.
