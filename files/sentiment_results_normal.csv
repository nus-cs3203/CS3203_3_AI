Some that have made it into the news in Singapore include Shopback letting go 24% of its employees, Lazada letting go an estimated 100 people, Unilever realigning its marketing team in Singapore, PropertyGuru laying off 79 employees, Tetra Pak closing down in Singapore and 300 employees will be affected, Electrolux relocating its regional HQ from Singapore to Bangkok, and more.This trend is not unique to Singapore either. Many of the biggest (and possibly smallest) companies globally are also looking to align its workforce with its requirements. They include Amazon to Google to Discord and Twitch.2 Retrenchment Statistics Are On The RiseAccording to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) the rate of retrenchments more than doubled in 2023. 14,590 workers were retrenched in 2023 compared to 6,440 in 2022.While more people may be looking for new roles, they will also be hit by a slowdown in job vacancies. In December 2023, the job vacancy to unemployment ratio was 1.74, compared to 2.30 in December 2022.3 Global Trends: Higher For Longer Interest Rates; Rise Of AI; E-Commerce SlowdownAs a small and open economy, Singapore has to adhere to global trends to stay relevant. An environment of higher interest rates will inevitably affect global growth – including in Singapore.With a signal that interest rates may stay elevated for a longer in 2024, investment sentiments may dampen on the back of higher borrowing costs.At the same time, the post-pandemic explosion in e-commerce has meant that many businesses pivoted into it. Not doing so would be akin to giving up the potential growth. Now, it may be time for companies to relook their initial hires. With technology constantly evolving, and potentially more companies jumping on the AI bandwagon now, there may be greater “churn” in the economy – as DPM and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned in his Singapore Budget 2024 speech.At the same time, AI and e-commerce are trends that are supposed to eventually lead to fewer headcount – and not more.

Almost everything there requires you to pay with card - from restaurants to the express passes for the rides. I think maybe only the souvenir shops accepted cash payment,” said Mr Chan.He and his wife spent three hours calling DBS, UOB and OCBC from the theme park - racking up $200 in roaming charges in the process - and would later find out that their cards had been cancelled by someone else who called the banks.This person, who posed as Mr Chan, asked the banks to do so on the pretext that he had lost his belongings.“We were shocked to find that all my credit cards were cancelled and our bank accounts were blocked. The bank officers told us that we would need to be back in Singapore to reinstate them,” said Mr Chan, who has reported the matter to the police.“My wife is Thai... so we transferred money from her bank account in Thailand to my YouTrip travel card.

The caller had apparently passed identity verification requests after a few failed attempts.Mr Chan said he is upset with the banks for not attempting to contact him when the caller initially failed the verification questions.When asked about what happened, a UOB spokesman said the bank prioritises the “swift securing of the customer’s account” against any unauthorised access.“Callers are required to provide personal details of the cardholders such as their NRIC number, card and account details.

However, some level of verification with cardholders would be ideal,” said Mr Sudheesan.“I support a callback verification mechanism, but freeze accounts in the meantime as opposed to immediately cancelling them at face value when a third party calls.”He added that impersonation could constitute an offence under the Penal Code, if a person is found to be cheating by pretending to be another person.

t3_xyu006,The astronomical increase in 3 room resale prices in the 4 cheapest non-mature estates from '19 to '22 vs wage growth for youths and seniors from '19 to '21,"We are concerned with small resale flats because they provide immediate housing to young couples, especially crucial for those planning on having children, and for singles 35 and over. They serve as a benchmark on how affordable it is to get married/have children.**Key takeaway**For the cheapest non-mature estates of Woodlands, Bukit Batok, Jurong West, and Yishun, prices rose from $240,000, $258,000, $260,000, and $260,000 in Q2 2019 to $337,000, $345,000, $340,000, and $360,000 in Q2 2022. That's an increase of 40.1%, 33.7%, 30.7%, and 38.4%! (I picked 4 instead of 3 because the 3rd place was tied in 2019.)Edit: a dual citizen couple earning $5,000 and not staying near parents would get $95,000 in grants. After 95k in grants, a three room flat at the median price in Jurong West and Woodlands, which had the smallest and largest increase in prices, would be $163,000 and $145,000, and $250,000 and $242,000 in 2019 and 2022 respectively. This is a **53.4% and 66.9%** increase respectively, which also applies for your monthly loan repayments! The repayments for a maximum 25 year HDB loan went from $592 and $526 for Jurong West and Woodlands to $907 and $878! That's more than the cost of infant care after subsidies ($264)! While this is still below the 30% of monthly pay threshold, shouldn't we be alarmed by the dramatic increase? **Wage growth in youth?**However, the wage growth from June 2019 to June 2021 for youth below 35 (excluding NSFs, full-time employed only, including CPF) was negative to negligible, which is a very different image from the overall median wage growth. Those from 55-59 had significantly higher wage growth. Therefore housing has been even more unaffordable for young couples than those who have been just become able to start withdrawing from CPF. And now, the prices of the most affordable small resale flats will likely rise even further than 5 room and larger because of the loophole for those who are above 55 being allowed buy a resale immediately without having to rent/move in with relatives for 15 months in the new restrictions on private to non-subsidised resale downgraders.From ages 20-24, 25-30, and 30-34, the median wage was respectively $2,730, $4,081 and $5,197 in 2019, and $2,691, $4,095, $5,222 in 2021. This was a change of -1.42%, 0.34%, and 0.48%.This contrasts with the 2.56% increase in overall median monthly income from $4,563 to S$4,680 over the same period.**Wage growth in seniors and consequences for the loophole**What about those able to take advantage of the loophole in the new regulations? Those aged 55-59 had their wages grow from $3,563 to $3,729, or 4.66%. That's 82.0% higher than the overall median monthly income growth.Those over 60 had their wages fall from $2,562 to $2,543, or -0.74%. That's around half the percentage loss than those from 20-24. Therefore, since those from 55-59 had wage growth nearly double of wage growth across all ages, shouldn't the loophole be at least limited to those over 60? **Conclusion and disclaimer**The resale prices for 3 room flats in non-mature estates have grown by much more since before the pandemic compared to wages across the youngest and oldest age groups, which have remained flat or even fallen.While the calculations for the increase in resale prices at the start of the post included an additional year of increase compared to the wage growth data, the extent of total increase deserves to be calculated. And I'm too tired from typing this from my phone already to take the 2021 Q2 resale data and compare the increase between both 2019 and 2022.Edit: only a few estates are offered BTO every quarter and the attractiveness of the developments vary. New flats made available after MOP would significantly change prices that quarter and afterwards. I could have used an average of Q1 and Q2 prices to smooth that out, which is more important than matching the Q2 prices with the June wage levels.Compound annual growth rate might have been a better option instead of a simple percentage growth over the initial value, I'm not sure.

t3_14zm9p3,My thoughts as a concerned Singaporean to the recent case of Minister Iswaran,"This was what DPM Lawrence Wong said during the doorstop interview on Wednesday (12 July). “We will be upfront and transparent, and we will not sweep anything under the carpet even if they are potentially embarrassing or damaging to the PAP and to the government”.I am certain many of us Singaporeans would have just found out that Minister Iswaran was in fact arrested on Tuesday (11 July) from what CPIB had released on Friday night. Many of us were made aware that from the press release statement announced by CPIB on Tuesday, “Minister S Iswaran is currently assisting the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) with the investigation into a case uncovered by CPIB.”Despite initial promises of transparency by DPM Lawrence Wong, the delayed disclosure and limited details regarding the investigation have left the public questioning the integrity of both the media and the government. On 12 July, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) released a statement acknowledging Minister Iswaran's involvement in an ongoing investigation. However, the lack of specific information regarding the nature of the investigation left the public in the dark. The statement seemed more like a carefully crafted public relations message than an honest account of the situation. It failed to live up to DPM Lawrence Wong's assurance that the government would be upfront and transparent, regardless of potential embarrassment. The subsequent statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on 13 July further exemplifies the lack of transparency in this very serious situation. Instead of providing clarity and full disclosure, PMO merely reiterated the information already known. It was revealed that Minister Iswaran would take a leave of absence and have no access to official resources, but no substantial details about the investigation were provided. This deliberate vagueness raises serious questions about the government's commitment to transparency and accountability.The consequences of sugar-coating the truth could extend far beyond this specific incident. When the media and the government prioritize maintaining a positive image over transparency, public trust erodes quickly. This erosion can have severe ramifications for democratic societies like Singapore, as citizens we become disillusioned and feel disconnected from those in power.

t3_1brho0v,Issue with SG Healthcare: Doctor working hours and why it affects you,"I’m a doctor working in Singapore. I think we’ve reached a point where most Singaporeans understand the main issues with our healthcare system. The system is tough on everyone including the nurses and allied health professionals.Junior doctors have many woes including renumeration, dealing with bureacracy, healthcare worker abuse. For this post, I would like to focus solely on the **most absurd** aspect of our current healthcare system: the working hours for doctors.Personally, this is most ridiculous existing issue and requires urgent, if not immediate change. The current system is outdated and disregards patient safety.It is easy for the general public to dismiss this issue and say things like “doctors knew what they were signing up for” etc, but this problem affects every Singaporean. Anyone could end up seeking treatment in a public hospital. Imagine if your loved one was being operated on by a doctor who has not slept in 24 hours. This possibly occurs on a daily basis. **Current Working Hours:**The average junior doctor reaches the hospital around 6-6.30am. This varies according to patient load in the hospital department, some doctors reach earlier at 5am or earlier based on manpower needs.The main reason for this early reporting time  varies depending on speciality and should be kept for a separate post. The main focus of this post is the call system.**Call System (Night Duty)**Overnight doctor duties in public hospitals are covered by the “call” system. This system is outdated and the main cause of the problem. Nurses operate on a shift system where continuous working hours are capped to the shift. A&E doctors also use shift systems. Some hospitals have progressed to a “night float” system which also caps continuous working hours. **However most hospitals still operate using the “call system” for doctors.**What exactly is a call system?Simply put, when doctors are “on call”, they are scheduled to cover the night shift for that day. The catch is that they work the whole day, cover the night shift, then proceed to work the next day as well.When doctors leave work after a call, it’s called going “post-call”. The official postcall timing is about 12pm, but this is subject to patient load. It is not unusual to leave at 2-3pm if needed, with the not-so-occasional horror stories of doctors going postcall at 6pm. Eg if a doctor is scheduled for “call” on 1st April; they will arrive at work about 6-6.30am on 1st April, work the whole day and night, then proceed to work the next morning as well. Ideally they will leave by 12pm on 2nd April and will have some rest before reporting to work as usual at 6am on 3rd April. An official “postcall timing” of 12pm makes each call a 30 hour shift. This means that every morning, you have doctors in SG with little to no sleep reviewing patients, ordering blood test and scans, precribing meds. Isn’t this crazy?Some hospital departments have tried to fix this problem by implementing an “8am postcall” system. This would mean that doctors would be able to leave the hospital at 8am after their call ends, bringing the average worktime per call to a ~26 hour shift. This prevents doctors from working the morning after the call which reduces the risk of sleep-deprived making medical errors.**What needs to be done?**Mandatory 8 am post-call timings should be a MOH priority. 26 hour shifts still sound ridiculous but it is still a first step in the right direction. Doctors should not be allowed to work continuously for >24 hours given the possibly harm to patients. **TLDR:** In Singapore, you have doctors on 30 hour shifts examining, prescribing meds and even performing surgery on your loved ones.",Healthcare,-0.8,0.9,0.9,-0.9533,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1brho0v/issue_with_sg_healthcare_doctor_working_hours_and/,Reddit,2024-03-30 13:17:00,"Issue with SG Healthcare: Doctor working hours and why it affects you I’m a doctor working in Singapore.

t3_1ervovr,Do something for your country this month: voice your objection to the sale of Income Insurance to Allianz,"This month (August 2024), do something for your country and for your family.   Write to your MP (and cc PM & DPM) to voice your unhappiness re the sale of Income Insurance to German insurer Allianz.Don’t know the email address of your MP?  Fret not, see below for a list of email addresses of all PAP MPs (and some PAP MP-wanna-be).  Apologies that I am not able to provide personal email addresses of all MPs, but if anyone has, please share (esp that of Ms Ng Ling Ling and Cheryl Chan Wei Ling).  [Note:  email addresses collated from publicly-available sources].  Apologies for the poor formatting … if anyone can improve the formatting, it will be much appreciated.Suggestions (to avoid any MPs inadvertently missing your email):(1) If more than one email address is given, suggest to include all email addresses in your email(2) If you live in a GRC, then write to all the email addresses of all the MPs in your GRC(3) Always cc the PM and DPM in all your emails to your MPs(4) Alternatively, you can address your email to your MP (including the other MPs in your GRC, if you’re in a GRC), and then cc the rest of the 70-80+ MPs in your email, so that at least some of them get to read your email.Feel free to draft your own email, or to use the following sample email (amend and improve as appropriate):Dear MP (or MP-wanna-be),I write to voice my unhappiness over the sale of Income Insurance to Allianz.  There are just so many things to object about this deal, including the following: (1) unfair treatment of minority shareholders vis-à-vis NTUC Enterprise, (2) breach of good faith by NTUC Enterprise re their statement to remain majority shareholder of Income post-corporatisation, (3) Income Insurance becoming a profit-maximisation commercial company, vs operating as a non-profit maximisation entity with social mission, which will impact on many of Income’s 1.7m existing policyholders,  (4) conflict or possible conflict of interest involved re Income appointing Morgan Stanley as their financial advisor etc, which was brushed over by MAS’s Mr Chee Hong Tat in Parliament recently etcI wish to also object to Income’s management, ex-Ministers and current Ministers spouting many absurd, illogical and redundant statements to gloss over the public’s objections to the sale.  Aside from making themselves look foolish, we, the constituents do NOT like your colleagues continuing to (i) talk us down, assuming that we are stupid and (ii) insult our intelligence.  Please stop trying to gloss over real facts and please stop assuming all your constituents are sheeple.    You would also do well to remind your colleagues (through the PM and DPM) that nonsensical comments by your ministers would be permanently imprinted on the internet, widely circulated in social media and the international press too.  Stop being the laughing stock the world over.There are many hundreds of thousands of other Singapore citizens who are not happy with the Income sale, but they are not writing to you, for various reasons. I am taking the time to write to you because I am concerned about the way this country is heading, including the sale of Income, which looks like the establishment is pushing down the throats of the stakeholders.   Stop the sale.Your response, or non-response, to my above views and my request, will determine how I vote in the coming General Elections.  Even if you are not standing in the next GE, it is your responsibility to share my email, and my views, with your successor(s), and with the PM and DPM.Awaiting a response from you on this matter (which can include your comments to the local press or on social media, but please publicise widely your views, or non-views).Regards,Your constituent, and voter in the next GE[Note: Feel free to copy-and-paste or share this post with everyone you know, including on social media]AMK GRC1Lee Hsien Loonglee_hsien_loong@pmo.gov.sg2Gan Thiam Pohgan.thiam.poh@amktc.org.sg3Darryl DavidDarryl.David@pap.org.sg;

Write to your MP (and cc PM & DPM) to voice your unhappiness re the sale of Income Insurance to German insurer Allianz.Don’t know the email address of your MP?  Fret not, see below for a list of email addresses of all PAP MPs (and some PAP MP-wanna-be).  Apologies that I am not able to provide personal email addresses of all MPs, but if anyone has, please share (esp that of Ms Ng Ling Ling and Cheryl Chan Wei Ling).  [Note:  email addresses collated from publicly-available sources].  Apologies for the poor formatting … if anyone can improve the formatting, it will be much appreciated.Suggestions (to avoid any MPs inadvertently missing your email):(1) If more than one email address is given, suggest to include all email addresses in your email(2) If you live in a GRC, then write to all the email addresses of all the MPs in your GRC(3) Always cc the PM and DPM in all your emails to your MPs(4) Alternatively, you can address your email to your MP (including the other MPs in your GRC, if you’re in a GRC), and then cc the rest of the 70-80+ MPs in your email, so that at least some of them get to read your email.Feel free to draft your own email, or to use the following sample email (amend and improve as appropriate):Dear MP (or MP-wanna-be),I write to voice my unhappiness over the sale of Income Insurance to Allianz.  There are just so many things to object about this deal, including the following: (1) unfair treatment of minority shareholders vis-à-vis NTUC Enterprise, (2) breach of good faith by NTUC Enterprise re their statement to remain majority shareholder of Income post-corporatisation, (3) Income Insurance becoming a profit-maximisation commercial company, vs operating as a non-profit maximisation entity with social mission, which will impact on many of Income’s 1.7m existing policyholders,  (4) conflict or possible conflict of interest involved re Income appointing Morgan Stanley as their financial advisor etc, which was brushed over by MAS’s Mr Chee Hong Tat in Parliament recently etcI wish to also object to Income’s management, ex-Ministers and current Ministers spouting many absurd, illogical and redundant statements to gloss over the public’s objections to the sale.  Aside from making themselves look foolish, we, the constituents do NOT like your colleagues continuing to (i) talk us down, assuming that we are stupid and (ii) insult our intelligence.  Please stop trying to gloss over real facts and please stop assuming all your constituents are sheeple.    You would also do well to remind your colleagues (through the PM and DPM) that nonsensical comments by your ministers would be permanently imprinted on the internet, widely circulated in social media and the international press too.  Stop being the laughing stock the world over.There are many hundreds of thousands of other Singapore citizens who are not happy with the Income sale, but they are not writing to you, for various reasons. I am taking the time to write to you because I am concerned about the way this country is heading, including the sale of Income, which looks like the establishment is pushing down the throats of the stakeholders.   Stop the sale.Your response, or non-response, to my above views and my request, will determine how I vote in the coming General Elections.  Even if you are not standing in the next GE, it is your responsibility to share my email, and my views, with your successor(s), and with the PM and DPM.Awaiting a response from you on this matter (which can include your comments to the local press or on social media, but please publicise widely your views, or non-views).Regards,Your constituent, and voter in the next GE[Note: Feel free to copy-and-paste or share this post with everyone you know, including on social media]AMK GRC1Lee Hsien Loonglee_hsien_loong@pmo.gov.sg2Gan Thiam Pohgan.thiam.poh@amktc.org.sg3Darryl DavidDarryl.David@pap.org.sg;

I always thought that ppl got a follow up before they went back to work but this is the first time I'm seeing that the doctor doesn't even need to follow up before I get back to work but can see me 3 wks afterwards.Is that normal in hospitals around Singapore or am I just the idiot who thinks that ppl should get the follow up before they go back to work? Or is it because I go back under subsidised, its OK for me to go to work first then see doctor for follow up afterwards?",0.8381,positive

As a land-scarce city, we should aspire for true car-lite urban infrastructure. That does not mean physically limiting the number of cars on the roads, but designing infrastructure and policies in such a way that people don't want to drive.For a lot of trips in Singapore, driving is still faster and more convenient than public transit. Excluding the initial capital outlay of purchasing a car, it's also not much more expensive, as Singapore has very cheap parking by international standards. This leads to 2 problems: 1) people who can afford cars want to buy cars, 2) people who already own cars want to drive cars.We need to design urban infrastructure to not accommodate and prioritize cars as much. That means dedicated cycling lanes, more bus lanes in residential areas, and more road diets for cars. We have excellent public transit, but we arguably have even better car infrastructure. Public transit should not be something you take because you can't afford a car, it should be something you want to take because it is overall a better experience.I don't know if this is possible, but I think it is something we should strive towards.

Anecdotally, I have coworkers in NYC who do own cars (because they moved from car-dependent suburbs) but rarely drive, because driving is simply a worse experience than taking public transit.Personally, I enjoy taking public transit in Singapore a lot - I don't have to think about traffic, it frees up time for me to read, it's inexpensive, it's clean, and there are no crazies around unlike in some other cities.
