E.g MCF salary range says 10-20k, but HR says 8k is the max they can offer.I am also pretty sure it's not a matter of job levelling or insufficient experience as I exceed the minimum years of experience in their job description. I actually applied for this role selectively after checking the salary range on MCF to ensure there's a chance they can meet my asking.

However, as a Heartlander, I'm hesitant to consider one because of *inadequate charging infrastructure* in HDB carparks. It seems to me that if the government were truly serious about increasing adoption, they'd focus more on building out charging infrastructure than on subsidizing cars. So the huge subsidy seems kind of odd to me.Moreover, whether intentional or not, the rebate looks a lot like a transfer of wealth *to the wealthy*, which directly contradicts all of the elites' *talk* about inequality.Why does it look like a transfer of wealth? Thing is, EVs are most convenient for landed property owners because they can charge them easily, so the wealthy are the ones most likely to buy EVs. Essentially, the government seems to be subsidizing a luxury good (let's be real, all cars are a luxury goods in Singapore at this point) that's mostly only accessible to the wealthy. Put another way, this is a subsidy that most plebs cannot and will never benefit from, which means it'll have a negative effect on already-bad wealth inequality. And it's not an insubstantial effect - the rebate is literally several decades worth of GST vouchers!Thoughts? Am I missing something or are our elites utterly disconnected from reality on this matter?-----Edit 1:Just to add some substantiation for my conclusions - Today published an [article](https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-short-more-evs-road-some-drivers-face-reality-check-2457356) on July 12, 2024 that stated:> EV drivers who live in landed property have the choice to install their own charger. But given that landed property make up less than 5 per cent of homes here, this is a privilege afforded by only the very few.>> Five of eight EV users whom TODAY spoke to live in condominiums and Housing and Development Board flats. **They either have to contend with sharing a few chargers with many residents, or charging elsewhere if there is no charging station in their estate**.Charging infrastructure really isn't great in the heartlands right now.Also interesting that only 5/8 of the EV users they spoke to live in condos/HDBs. Yes, it's a teeny tiny sample but still interesting to note.-----Edit 2:Did more reading, found more relevant substantiation in a recent CNA [article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/big-read/electric-vehicles-ev-charger-infrastructure-costs-big-read-4477561):> ""On average, our (BYD) buyers are in the 30 to 55 age range and are quite evenly spread among the different property types (HDB flats, condominiums and landed homes),"" said the spokesperson.**Despite 77% of Singaporeans living in HDBs and only 5% living in landed, buyers of BYDs are evenly spread among owners of different property types. So there *is* a significant overrepresentation of landed/condo owners. Moroever BYD is the value-for-money EV brand.**> “As a car is a big-ticket item in Singapore, it is not surprising that the main bulk of (EV) buyers are in the 40 to 60 years old range,” said a spokesperson for the company, which distributes brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Kia and Citroën, among others.>> “They are also more male-dominated; **many of them more affluent and staying in private residences.**”**More confirmation that the recipients of the subsidies are disproportionately wealthy.**> Compounding the problem is that the **growth in charging stations has lagged behind the growth of EVs**, going by figures since 2020.This was my sense of things from personal experience.

t3_119af6q,Can the government tweak COE policy to make it more fair? Details inside!,reddit,Transport,2023-02-22 20:02:00,0.9833,"**TL;DR at the bottom!**If someone suggested this before and there was a constructive debate over this, please link me. I can't find anything in recent history.Here's my idea that I hope any sensible MP can bring up regarding our ridiculous COE prices.The whole reason for 'COE' was originally to control the number of cars on the road so traffic is sustainable. Fair enough. Now it's widening the inequality gap between rich and poor. I know rich people whose households own multiple cars. The father, wife, son, daughter, everyone in the immediate family has their own car. 1 person might even have multiple cars in their garage. Bidding for the COE is literally not an issue for them. Even if COE is 200k tomorrow they will snap their fingers and buy a new car because at that point of wealth, the price doesn't matter anymore. Do you think they feel alot of pain when their Porsche costs $900k instead of $800k?Meanwhile, middle and lower income families could really use a family car to settle their transportation needs. The utility value for them is so much more important than the wealthy dude who needs a *10th Ferrari to flex*.**How to solve this?**Why not let every *Singapore Citizen* household (with minimally a married couple, with or without kids), to have their first COE subsidized (can scale according to their income level!) or price capped to something more *reasonable* e.g. $30k? Then, every subsequent car that you want to buy within the household (like if you're getting a 2nd car within the family), the price of that 2nd COE will skyrocket to $200k (I'm using random numbers here btw, you get the gist that the 2nd COE price should be deservedly higher because it's a greed, not a need for the family). If you still want to greed a 3rd car, 4th car, the COE becomes exponentially higher like $300k, $500k. Because a mega-wealthy person that can buy multiple cars without flinching can contribute to the subsidy this way. And a lot of people like that exist in Singapore, just take a walk around Bukit Timah estates. Not even exaggerating here.*It is still an auction system btw - the supply of COE will still be controlled and limited by the govt. LTA can decide exactly how much subsidy they can give to first-timers. The point is to not let the auction spiral out of control due to wealth inequality.*This solves the **first counter-argument** to this proposal - if people want to say the government has to commercialize COE like a business, then LTA still gets their profit - but at least they extract more money from the upper-rich class who insists on having more than 1 car. Households (especially those with kids to fetch) who really need that ONE car will be happy to pay a subsidized fee, and rich families (who really WANT that 2nd car for pure flexing, idk) will also be happy to pay a more expensive $200k COE. I mean, if you're a 'rich' family and you're not happy at paying an additional $100k levy for multiple cars then maybe consider that you don't really need a second car in the first place? The irony right?**Second counter-argument:** you may say that COE prices are sky-high now because of all the private-hire companies buying up COE bids and placing more rental cars on the road - in this case, there should be a separate category for private-hire car COEs. Let all the corporate companies have a bidding war against each other. Let it be a free market competition amongst the corporate giants. Leave us peasants out of it. I really don't care if Grab or Gojek or Tada goes bankrupt and loses the war. With this implementation, the demand for private-hire car rides will naturally drop because most lower and middle income families are able to have their own family car, and we won't see the need for so much parents ferrying kids around in grab. A side-effect is that more people will take public transport too, if the prices of taking Grab becomes too disgustingly high because of this new implementation.**Third counter-argument:** Single people! (I'm single too btw). There can be a single-bid category as well, but I expect this to be as expensive as our current COE prices, being left up to free market forces (*but without the pesky private-hire companies chupping in ofc*). If you have proof that you moved out from your parent‚Äôs home and are living an independent life, you can be decoupled from the multiple car category above. If you have a better idea to this, comment below!**Final counter-argument:** If the household has way too many kids (&gt;4 kids), they may consider appealing to the government for a subsidized COE for a 2nd car due to the nature of having a large family, and this appeal is more likely to go through especially when the kids have gone past &gt;25 years old and are of working age. Anyway, I think this problem may solve itself because if all the kids are finally in the working stages of their life, they can consider getting married and create a new household, thus being eligible for their 1st car subsidy.*I also want to add a footnote that we have an aging population - i.e. lower birthrates and not enough kids to replace parents. Since this implementation should only apply to citizens (PR debatable), the supply of first-time car owners on the road should be decreasing over time, so the subsidy system should be sustainable over a long-run.*Redditors, economists and philosophy PHDs, please feel free to chime in, poke holes in this theory, and explain why no MP ever thought about this yet in parliament :(**TL;DR** COE system should change - 1st car for every family household be heavily subsidized, then any additional car without legit reasons should be slapped with a way more expensive COE to make up for the subsidized ones. The supply of cars on the road will be the same.EDIT: I see good suggestions that the subsidy should be removed, just slap ABSD on the 2nd/multiple car COE owners, which will naturally bring down the price of the 1st car COE owner. Thank you and that was smart.People also mentioned we will be flooded with cars on the road with the subsidy. I don‚Äôt think this will be the case because we are only asking for a subsidy, not a free COE. Families still have to think twice if they need to pay 50% of current COE price, which is still like $40k (not including the car).",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/119af6q/can_the_government_tweak_coe_policy_to_make_it/

t3_107bcga,TIL: HDB officers never answer phone calls to their office number,reddit,Infrastructure,2023-01-09 10:42:00,0.9429,"TLDR: If you need help from HDB and called up HDB branch service line, they will probably give you contact numbers (yes, sometimes more than one number) of the officer supposedly in charge. But watch out - these numbers never go through! Instead, you should ask the service line for the officer's office location and go down there!I recently sold my HDB flat to buy a new one, and had to deal with HDB several times due to different hiccups. The lesson I learned is that, the contact number of HDB officers that I got from HDB branch service line are useless. The officers won't answer those calls, some go directly to voice mail, some just no pick-up, ever. There was one time, I kept calling one officer for like weeks, until her voice mailbox is FULL - but still no answer or call-back! This happened again today, the officer‚Äôs number I got from HDB branch service line directly goes to voice mail. Knowing this is a dead-end, I decided to go down to the branch office that I believe the officer should be based in. I went down to the office, I asked the reception lady to help me speak to the officer, and guess what? The lady pulled out her mobile, dialled a number and got the elusive officer on speaker immediately! The reception lady later told me that she called the officer's personal number, not any of her work number - that's how we got to get her. I was also told the officer‚Äôs personal number will never be given to customers, so I will never get to speak to her on my own. Lesson of my story: if you need to find an HDB officer, don't waste your time calling their numbers, just directly head down to their office!Edit: about emailing - my experience with emailing HDB officers is a mix bag, some would reply, some would not. For those replying, it usually takes 4-6 days, which really doesn‚Äôt cut for urgent matters (when it comes to resale and renovation, most issues are urgent) Today at branch office, the reception lady actually helped me submit a document through her internal message system to the officer, she told me it‚Äôs faster than email. I got a reply from the officer in the afternoon, so much faster than I ever had with any email to HDB! Again, the gist is - when you need truly urgent help from HDB, try going down to branch office, the officers there make things happen so much faster then us calling and emailing on our own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/107bcga/til_hdb_officers_never_answer_phone_calls_to/

Things generally move and evolve quickly. You'd think that people on the streets would have some self/social awareness and not do things that are inconsiderate or just plain inefficient. Yet, almost on a daily basis, you encounter things like- people stopping abruptly in places with heavy traffic flow e.g. in the middle of the main corridor between a row of shops in a crowded shopping centre (especially the link between Ngee Ann City and Wisma, holy shit), in the middle of a food court where people usually walk to go to their tables, at the foot of escalators- people not looking where they are going, or (linked to the above) turning around and immediately walking into another person without bothering to see if there is someone in the way- people walking slowly in the middle of a crowded walkway- people not keeping to the left, walking multiple persons abreast (PCN got quite a few of these clowns)- people walking on cycling lanes (I don't like how some cyclists ride but this is just asking for trouble)- people walking and looking at their phones, creating hazards/obstructions for others - people walking slowly when everyone else around them is walking quite fastWhen you travel to other busy cities like New York, Tokyo or Taipei, you generally don't encounter these things (rarely).

In point 3, MOF says the list is what ""individuals would like to have"" and ""not just about basic needs ""However in the [FAQ](https://whatsenough.sg/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/),  it is mentioned participants were told 1. ""The study is about needs, not wants""  2. ""The final budgets should ensure a basic standard of living and *not be a wish list of things that would be good to have*""3. The earliest focus group discussions produced a definition of a basic standard of living including ""work-life balance"" and ""enables a sense of belonging, respect, security and independence"" and ""includes choices to participate in social activities"" among othersIt appears that MOF-MOM-MSF is talking about *Basic needs for* ***Survival*** whereas the study and participants are talking about *Basic standards of* ***Living*** (Emphasis mine)This suggests a mismatch in working defitions at best and a disregard for what actual Singaporeans consider ""Basic Standards"" at worstThis mismatch of definitions underscores all further points raised&#x200B;B. In point 16i, MOF-MOM-MSF suggests ""As the focus groups included higher-income participants, the conclusions may not be an accurate reflection of basic needs"" as a limitation in the 2021 and 2023 report. The inclusion of "" jewellery, perfumes, and overseas holidays was raised""While not mentioned in the 2023 full report, since they mentioned the 2021 study had this limitation, that claim shall be examined from that point of view. This concern was already directly addressed in the [FAQ](https://whatsenough.sg/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)In the 2021 study, 15% of participants lived in private properties but 18% lived in public rental flats (provided by the HDB for lower-income households)At 15% it reasonably [represents demographics of those living in private properties in 2021](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-singapore-residents-living-in-condos-rise-in-households-with-fewer-members)This transates to each focus of approx 8 participants, having between 1-2 participants living in private property and 1-2 participants living in lower-income HDB provided rentalsWhen it came to items, all had to agree it was a ""need"" in order for it to be on the budget. If there was no consensus, it was left outMultiple rounds of focus groups were used to identify this list of ""needs""For Jewellery, an example is a mother who had an annual budget of $50 for jewellery and participants echoed that for things like earrings, hair clips and brooches are necessary because it is important to look presentable at work.Unfortunately, I could not find an example for perfume.Examples of ""Holidays"" were 4-day-3-night trips to Ipoh and Port Dickson by coach. If this holiday is not catered for in the budget, it would mean that families on a basic standard of living will never be able to travel outside of Singapore in their lifetimes. No participant suggested this was a reasonable minimum. That the Ministries raised a point about this reasserts that the parties are operating on vastly different opinions of ""Basic""&#x200B;C. 16ii asserts that ""lower-income families qualify for and receive more financial help""The issue raised by the study is that means-testing and other eligibility factors are too restrictive and not sufficient to achieve a basic standard of livingAnd there are definitely lower-income families who have fallen through the cracks and do not receive excess support. To not account for them would be remistD.In 16iv the Ministries mentions their ""analysis suggests that the proposed monthly MIS budget of around $1,680 per capita is similar to the average monthly expenditure of $1,650 per capita for all families with children rather than reflecting a more basic set of needs""However, this may be a more purely economical, calculating and cold figureIt may not take into account the more human aspect of living which is what the MIS accounts for. The elderly Singaporean auntie that works as a cleaner should be able to afford ""respect, security, and independence"" in her own country.It is also not certain if the number accounts for potential issues like medical issues or other personal needs   Additional thoughts on other points will expanded on if asked in the comments, post is too long alreadyTLDR; Gov seems to think Minimum Income Standards as ""Basic mean for Survival"", the study and participants see it as ""Basic means of Living"".

This post is written with the intention of general sharing only. Anything I say is solely based on my experience and what others have shared. (If I remember correctly) This pathway was first introduced in 2020 when all the autonomous unis started offering spots to adult learners who fit the criteria. Said criteria: (I) 25 years old and above as of 1 July of matriculating year, (II) have 4 years of work experience, (III) SG / PR citizen, (IV) does not have a prior degree studied/read.I applied in 2021 to: [SUSS](https://www.suss.edu.sg/full-time-undergraduate/admissions/eligibility), [SIT](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/adult-learners), [NUS](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/AdvanceNUS) and [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admission-guide/adult-learners-scheme). I did not apply to [SMU](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/programmes/smu-higher-education-pathway-adult-learners-heal), but they also do have their higher education pathway. Respective unis' adult learner pathways are called differently. Results: Was put on reserve for SUSS but eventually rejected, SIT and NUS rejected me too. Only NTU accepted me :')Other than the usual admin application process, here are the individual interview process:SUSS: zoom group interview with other applicants (probably fresh grad poly/JC).SIT, NUS: no interviewNTU: Online recorded interview. 6 general admission interview questions, 4 where they will record you, and 2 written. For the recorded questions, they will flash out the question, give u some seconds to think and they will start recording. You have 2 takes for each question. Can't really remember what they asked, but one of the questions was I think why the 6 choices and why in that order.

I kind of knew deep down I only wanted to stop studying once I obtained at least a degree..... so yeah just nice I turned 25 in 2020 but because my birthday is in August..... :'))))) BUT ITS FINE I got accepted and that's all that mattersMy gpa in poly was...... 3.05..... y'all.............. if anyone has the same gpa, y'all can try applying!!! hahahaSome advice:(i) For NTU, please ONLY apply to SINGLE DEGREES. For all 6 choices. I did the mistake of putting double major...... lolAlso, I put my first 3 choices as biological sciences, thinking there's a higher chance that I would be accepted, and biz in the rest of my choices cos I felt that it's a course that would be easier to transition to from another diploma course. just FYI(ii) NUS requires you to give your latest CPF statement or payslip I think? also, NUS makes it compulsory for you to put your 2 referees and they have to be supervisors from your current workplace(iii) IIRC SMU requires you to submit personal statement. rest of unis don't haveQns I have received from other Redditors before:1. Does NTU ALS restrict the degrees that you apply for, depending on your diploma? - I guess not? I transitioned from a pharmacy diploma to a business degree. Though I think some O level subjects would help for some courses... like maybe Amath, POA, pure Geog, Pure sci, etc.2. What was your GPA? - 3.053. Course intake for each year? - idk hahaha but from the news, autonomous unis have now started giving [more spots](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/working-adults-may-get-more-opportunities-pursue-degrees-moe-funded-programmes-2544086) to adult learners !! what yall waiting for4. Do you get a class with other adult learners, or combined with the normal students? - combined. Think the adult learner intake is not that many for them to cater a specialised class for adult learners hahaha don't worry though, if you enter in the late 20s, you'll blend in pretty well.5. Do you click well with your peers? - Actually yes. Don't have to reveal your age or that you are an adult learner. Only tell when you're comfortable with it :) from my experience, I only reveal it to some of my groupmates... and don't think so much about how they are 6/7 years younger and you'll be fine.... HAHAHA6. Is there any fellow adult learners in your class or cohort? - have yet to meet any.... so yeah you can roughly gauge how ""rare"" I am7. How are you coping after a 4 year break from school? -  Lmao this question is üíØ hahha I mean I guess I‚Äôm doing ok, not too bad but not too good either, just floating and trying to survive. I feel like I‚Äôm an oldie cos my peers can sleep late and wake up early but I guess my body needs/want that 8 hours of sleep‚Ä¶.. so ya as long as you know your limits‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. just live in the moment and you‚Äôll do fine too üëçüèª 8. If I overload, can I graduate earlier? - for ntu I don't think you can overload........ you'd have to write in why you want to overload and you also somewhat need to prove that you can do well albeit overloading.... which means you have to I guess get FCH in y1s1? 9. Are we able to apply for financial aid like other students? - yesAll the best to all adult learners applying to uni this year! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/10lwu27/my_experience_on_applying_to_local_universities/

And the recent public and private housing pricing crisis plus the fact that public housing flats are aging is exacerbating the sentiment that perhaps Leasehold is headed towards a ‚Äòdoomsday‚Äô scenario when the older flats completely age out. I‚Äôve seen CSJ‚Äôs arguments but tbh am very unimpressed. It just seems to rant nonstop and offers no feasible alternatives whatsoever other than to fling around loads of ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù.So let‚Äôs just get a mini-discussion going here: what should be done otherwise or how should we change the way public housing is handled in Singapore? Keep in mind that land is finite, and in short supply here.Thoughts?My own take on this:1) Artificially deflate and control public housing pricing based off current inflation rates (for eg) and force existing public housing out of the speculation of private market. Based on geographic locations, set price ceilings for public housing. In fact, we already do this for new BTOs by setting the guide price before purchase. We just need to extend this to the resale market.  **Public housing was NEVER supposed to be a speculative asset. End of story.** 2) Related to point 1), Increase MOP for PLH BTOs to 20 years. You like the prime area right? Make sure you willing to stay ultra long-term.3) Introduce more concrete private housing cooling measures to ensure foreigners don‚Äôt buy up our residential areas (recent announcement might count but more can be done).4) Buyout close to aged out HDB plots at discounted or equal to fair market value to build new BTO plots. In essence we ‚Äòrecycle‚Äô aged out HDB plots without screwing over the plot‚Äôs owners since (see point 1) public housing pricing is controlled, they could always buy elsewhere w the buyout money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1582rwm/what_should_be_done_about_singapores_hdb_system/

Some that have made it into the news in Singapore include Shopback letting go 24% of its employees, Lazada letting go an estimated 100 people, Unilever realigning its marketing team in Singapore, PropertyGuru laying off 79 employees, Tetra Pak closing down in Singapore and 300 employees will be affected, Electrolux relocating its regional HQ from Singapore to Bangkok, and more.This trend is not unique to Singapore either. Many of the biggest (and possibly smallest) companies globally are also looking to align its workforce with its requirements. They include Amazon to Google to Discord and Twitch.2 Retrenchment Statistics Are On The RiseAccording to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) the rate of retrenchments more than doubled in 2023. 14,590 workers were retrenched in 2023 compared to 6,440 in 2022.While more people may be looking for new roles, they will also be hit by a slowdown in job vacancies. In December 2023, the job vacancy to unemployment ratio was 1.74, compared to 2.30 in December 2022.3 Global Trends: Higher For Longer Interest Rates; Rise Of AI; E-Commerce SlowdownAs a small and open economy, Singapore has to adhere to global trends to stay relevant. An environment of higher interest rates will inevitably affect global growth – including in Singapore.With a signal that interest rates may stay elevated for a longer in 2024, investment sentiments may dampen on the back of higher borrowing costs.At the same time, the post-pandemic explosion in e-commerce has meant that many businesses pivoted into it. Not doing so would be akin to giving up the potential growth. Now, it may be time for companies to relook their initial hires. With technology constantly evolving, and potentially more companies jumping on the AI bandwagon now, there may be greater “churn” in the economy – as DPM and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned in his Singapore Budget 2024 speech.At the same time, AI and e-commerce are trends that are supposed to eventually lead to fewer headcount – and not more. Once the initial gains have been made, the sensible thing may be to stay lean.https://dollarsandsense.sg/business/why-singapore-employees-need-to-be-ready-for-retrenchment-in-2024/Reposting since the first link was going somewhere else for some reason.",https://dollarsandsense.sg/business/why-singapore-employees-need-to-be-ready-for-retrenchment-in-2024/

t3_10tf9x5,Singaporeans are getting complacent about risk of extremism,reddit,Employment,2023-02-04 12:27:00,-0.9732,"For 20+ years the Singapore Malay/Muslim community is successful in countering extremist ideology. Measures include licensing/regulation for asatizahs (teachers of Islam) + sermons/material to clarify misconceptions + religious counselling for radicalised Muslim Singaporeans + looking out for those at risk. That is why Singapore not yet kena terrorist attack compared to the communist threat in 1960s.I think this success made Singaporeans complacent about extremist ideology which can also come from other groups:* Many Christians in Singapore kena influenced by Trump like ideology (like the Indian boy who plan to attack mosques).* Many traditional Chinese in Singapore kena brainwashed by China propaganda.* Some liberal Singaporeans (usually with more economic privilege) are becoming more radical and polarising.* Some Malay/Muslim Singaporeans are getting tired of community efforts to counter extremist ideology. More are feeling alienated from wider Singapore society.There are many possible factors for the slight increase in extremist ideology in Singapore:* Impact of pandemic on Singapore society + social cohesion. For example, increase in racism against Chinese in 2020 then Indians during Delta. Many elderly forced to rely on digital media despite limited technical skills + limited media literacy (easily misled by fake news).* Impact of pandemic + inflation (also housing crisis) pushed many poor families to breaking point. To see rich Westernised Singaporeans enjoying life + elitism rubs salt into the wounds.* Extremist recruiters/influencers become smarter to use same psychology tricks as scammers + take advantage of existing fault lines in our society (like language barriers) + target most vulnerable.* Extremism from any group adds to mistrust/insecurity in other groups which can add to extremism in other groups leading to a vicious cycle/multiplier effect (not sure of correct term).Only a small percentage of Singaporeans believe in extremist ideology and among them only a small percentage will resort to violence. But if the above trends multiply the small percentage by 3 (example number) that can be the difference leading to hate crimes/first successful terrorist attack.True stories of two people I know who are affected by extremist ideology (details vague to protect identities):* A close friend from secondary school + his family are traditional Chinese but when they invite me to their place they serve halal food + his parents (Chinese educated with limited English) talk to me in Malay. During Covid his parents start to use Chinese social media a lot for news/music/movies + buy cheap stuff. His mother passed away due to Covid. While he + family are greiving (so burning more but still try to be responsible) kena conflict with another Chinese family over their burning. Then got financial/legal stuff to settle (like insurance/will) but the father don't know how (all in English) and tried to get help on Chinese social media. The father read a lot of China propaganda then kena brainwashed. He keeps telling his children he would support China to attack Singapore to kill all the jiak kantang Singaporeans who want to destroy Chinese culture + keep traditional Chinese Singaporeans in poverty. Even asked my friend to shoot jiak kantang Singaporeans during NS. Friend/siblings don't want to report him because he was a great father for many years + they scared they kena starved if he kena arrested.* A cousin (we grew up together) with special needs who is intelligent but naive + quiet. Pandemic dashed his family's (and mine) hopes of escaping poverty (his therapy also kena disrupted). He recently completed mainstream education (kena bullied a lot) but struggling to find job due to poor economy + racial discrimination + special needs challenges. He spends most of the time on the computer. Few months ago he shared in family Whatsapp group screenshots of LGBT supporters here insulting people who oppose LGBT rights as retarded + comparing them to ISIS.  When I found out he surfs a lot of extremist material I told his mother but she said better not report. She thinks with his condition he is not able to carry out any attack + police will not be able to handle him properly. She will try to find an asatizah familiar with special needs to talk to him but is not high priority compared to day to day economic survival.Hope we can take the threat seriously + have a rationale discussion about how to counter extremist ideology.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/10tf9x5/singaporeans_are_getting_complacent_about_risk_of/

t3_zeynjd,Discussion on SIM swap attack,reddit,Public Safety,2022-12-07 11:18:00,0.7595,"Hi everyone, just wanted to have a discussion and also a PSA on the risks of SIM swapping in Singapore. My post was removed previously as I went into details on how to perform the attack so here's an abridged version without a step-by-step guide on how to become a criminal.Background: SIM Swapping attacks is when a cyber criminal takes over your SIM card and use that to take over your accounts. As these requires precise maneuvers, it's not realistic to do a blanket general attack and works well targeting specific individuals.As the adversary, you would find a target, preferably someone who is involved in cryptocurrencies as money-laundering is extremely through BTC/ETH/USDT tumbers. Finding a target is easy if you know how to dig for information online.After obtaining key information, the next bit is the most important: taking over the target's SIM card. With an NRIC, phone number and name, it's trivial to find the required information to take over the target's SIM card. You can find the target's telco by using the web portal of any telco. Login via Starhub, SingTel via phone number or NRIC. Telcos like redONE, TPG, CMLink, Singtel, Starhub, M1 will tell you if the NRIC/phone number is registered under their company.Here's the important part: sign up with TPG (Simba) and request for number porting. I use TPG as the postman DOES NOT check with the owner and simply delivers it as normal mail to you. Another alternative is e-sim providers like circle life and MyRepublic. I’m not familiar with the exact delivery and checks but a quick run through shows that circle life does not request for singpass. An attacker with a spoofed/leaked IC could pull this off remotely. Correct me if I’m wrong here. As SIM card porting happens at 12am to avoid service disruption, it also gives the adversary a time span of almost 6hrs to perform the hack. This is more than enough time for an experienced adversary to take over your entire net worth if you're not careful. One way of covering it up is buying cryptocurrency via debit/credit card and using a tumbler to money launder. Most e-wallets don’t seem to employ more security features and provides the debit card info in-app as well. A well planned attack could also directly target someone with a high value cryptocurrency exchange account. Key weaknesses:* Telco companies not securing their number porting process. No telco right now requires a photo of you holding your IC for number porting or new sign-ups. TPG does not even require actual verification upon delivery. (TPG please wake up your idea)* Telco companies giving away private information. With any number/NRIC in Singapore, it's almost trivial to check what telco the target is using.* Lack of 2FA on most platforms. Grab, EZ-Link, Shoppee, ShopBack, Fave and Singtel Dash do NOT support 2FA. Only a few of those listed above supports SingPass which is a much more secure way of logging in.* Allowing p2p to continue to exist: Singapore is not stamping this out and unfortunately this is a legitimate way to get hacked. What the government should do is legitimise this and require SingPass to register an account, rendering fake accounts almost impossible.How to protect yourself:* Get a burner number for PayNow, or stop using PayNow all together. Use bank account numbers directly to transfer instead of PayNow. * Use a private number for services and another public number for communication. This does not prevent data leaks from these services leaking your private number though.* Stop using SMS OTP and stick to 2FA like Authy, KeepassXC.* Use a password manager like Bitwarden. Seriously it's 2022, everyone should use a password manager.* Use a email forwarder like AnonAddy. Buying Protonmail's premium package also bundles such services for you so you won't be exposed in the event of an email leaks.What service providers (and governments) should do:* Stop outsourcing security to SMS OTP which is basically Swiss Cheese (full of holes). The telcos DO NOT care about security, not to mention SMS is unencrypted and unsecure. Even using email OTP is safer than SMS OTP.* Use SingPass as the OTP delivery provider. SingPass has an inbox feature which I find is a much needed gap between full blown 2FA and SMS OTP. Logging into SingPass requires a face scan and your account is disabled after multiple password attempts. By outsourcing the security to SingPass, most services can be locked down fairly easily. EZ-Link has the option to login via SingPass but does not mandate SingPass login and does not use the inbox feature either.* Allow end users to use 2FA. None of the service providers above allows 2FA which is beyond me.* Allow end users to disable SMS OTP. No point in using 2FA/SingPass if SMS OTP can still be used.* Banks should allow users to choose another number for PayNow. I want to use a public number for PayNow and a private number for OTPs from the bank. * As one commenter pointed out, PayNow setup should ask the owner to set it up with a nickname instead of a real name.Please let me know if I have anything wrong. This subreddit has a lot more savvy users and it'd be interesting to hear improvements and discussions on this topic.P.S. Popo please don't go after me.

Obviously it's a sensitive topic, and people have differing views.But I think by and large, a lot of the racist stuff we see in sg are more societal rather than institutional, like the dude saying interracial marriages are wrong, landlords not wanting Indian tenants, etc. When we look at an institutional level (aka the govt policy), there's very few (or some would say no) overtly discriminatory policies. Any policy that is debatably ""racist"" often has some mildly legitimate reason for existing. Whether you agree with the given reason is another matter, and not the point of this post. But there's one policy I can't wrap my head around that I think is totally inexcusable but somehow not talked about enough. And that is, how the government classifies malays/muslims as being ""less loyal"" and hence deemed to have lower security clearance when working in govt and even during NS. The only argument I've heard is ""what if sg goes to war with Malaysia"". Which makes 0 sense. Because Chinese who were born/have parents from Malaysia are somehow alright. But a malay who has lived here for generations is more likely to betray sg. We even have ministers like khaw boon wan who was born in penang and no one bats an eye.The government doesn't even have a response. I've tried searching it up, and their response just boils down to denying it happens and alluding to not being able to disclose this for national security reasons. Every other policy that involves race, from ethnic quota for hdb, sap schools, grc, or whatever else, there is at least an attempt to justify their position. Not for this.And it has a very real impact. Civil servants and military personnel are literally prevented from promoting because of this. I recall there was a post sometime back of someone being let go from the civil service, with hints of it being due to her security clearance/race. It fits the most literal definitions of institutional racism. It is the state discriminating on the basis of race.Do people think this is a serious problem, or am I just exaggerating the magnitude of this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/116aqrf/institutional_racism_in_singapore/

And the bar for gazetting isn't exactly high: to name a few, MacDonald House and Padang - a literal field - have been made national monuments solely because of the historical events that have transpired there. There is a strong public interest in preserving 38 Oxley, and under any other circumstances, that would be the straightforward decision.What complicates 38 Oxley is LKY's dying wish for it to be demolished. But this really shouldn't be too much of a complication,  just as an owner of a conserved shophouse cannot simply demolish the shophouse for redevelopment simply because it was his ""dying wish"". Accommodations and compromises to the owner's wishes can and should be made where possible, but ultimately, when It conflicts with the public interest, it should always be the latter that triumphs; in fact, it should be laudable that the government is prepared to override his wishes, for it exemplifies that nobody, not even LKY himself, stands above the state.It is thus odd that some figures in the opposition - who I assume in any other situation would be (rightfully) very critical if they even catch a whiff of the Lees being given preferential treatment - are leading the charge against conservation of 38 Oxley on the basis that we should respect LKY's dying wish.  Maybe they are guided by a belief that the preservation of the house is done by today's government for electoral reasons: I am unable to see how this can be the case. Even if 38 Oxley is made into a shrine extolling the virtues and values of the PAP, historical narratives can still be challenged outside of museum exhibits. And even then, these narratives do not automatically translate into electoral performances, and may in fact backfire  - creating a romanticised narrative of LKY's PAP would inevitably lead to the present government paling in comparison. Moreover, can I respectfully suggest that if the opposition finds themselves unable to win because a house is not demolished, they have more pressing issues to worry about and have no business winning elections?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g4bntw/cmv_38_oxley_should_be_gazetted_as_a_national/

Their 'needs' refer to the need of intellectual stimulation beyond the range of peers at their age. For example, gifted kids at P3 can already be learning about A-level Science concepts at their own free time. You might also ask about the difference between a gifted student and a high ability (HA hereafter) student. Gifted students are literally years ahead compared to their peers. These gifted students make up only 1% of the student cohort ^(\^1) ([source](https://www.todayonline.com/news/gep-revamp-students-pupils-high-ability-programmes-pri-3-pri-6-2478901)). HA students make up around 7% of the student population^(\^1) ([source](https://www.todayonline.com/news/gep-revamp-students-pupils-high-ability-programmes-pri-3-pri-6-2478901)).This clear distinction between the gifted and HA students are also apparent in class. HA students tend to get bored in class as well, but they are not infallible and still tend to have many learning gaps. Gifted students get bored in class, mostly because they really know and understand everything in the normal curriculum.>**The goals of the GEP are to:**>Develop intellectual depth and higher level thinking.>Nurture productive creativity.>Develop attitudes for self-directed lifelong learning.>Enhance aspirations for individual excellence and fulfilment.>Develop a strong social conscience and commitment to serve society and the nation.>Develop moral values and qualities for responsible leadership.The GEP programme was literally started to meet the increased intellectual needs of 1% of our population, to allow them to achieve their potential. If current MOE leaders can't tell the difference between a gifted child and a HA child, they're really being deliberately disingenuous. **Why is the GEP curriculum special?**Based on [MOE's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240826082605/https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/gifted-education/enrichment-model), the GEP curriculum covers more advanced topics, goes deeper and provides for collaboration with tertiary institutions.They are also able to embark on [Individualised Study Options (ISOs)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240826083255/https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/gifted-education/individualised-study-options), where they do real research through special programmes.**How are students selected?**Based on [MOE's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20231116020807/https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/gifted-education/identification/identification-exercise), there are 2 stages: 1. Screening test (EL and Math)2. Selection test (EL, Math and General Ability)Students who pass both tests will be posted to a GEP school where they will be put in a GEP class (of 20-30(?)) students who will undergo a *specialized GEP* curriculum. # Why has the GEP programme been abolished?From the press release [^(1)](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/gep-revamp-more-pupils-to-get-access-to-high-ability-programmes-starting-with-primary-1-cohort-from-2024), the goal of this abolishment was to:* Broaden opportunities for pupils (benefit more pupils)* Move away from assessing them by a single yardstick (GEP selection)**How will it work?**Based on a [press release](https://www.todayonline.com/news/gep-revamp-students-pupils-high-ability-programmes-pri-3-pri-6-2478901):1. Screening test at P3 will be kept, while the second stage (selection test) will be dropped. 2. Students who are selected will take part in school-based programmes (E2K Science/Math, EL writing or debate).3. Students will have multiple opportunities to join these school-based programmes from P4-P6.4. ""GEP"" students have opportunities to go to other schools for after-school programmes.**These school-based programmes have already been targeting HA students for the past 20-30 years**The only observable change is that instead of a single selection process at the end of P3, now students can get assessed every year to join these programmes. Touting the new approach as: >""largely similar"" to the current programmes for higher-ability learners and the current GEP programmeIs extremely disingenuous as after-school programmes that run for 1 hour each week are nowhere close to the goals or execution of the GEP curriculum. The existing after-school programmes will just be expanded to accommodate 10% (up from 7%) of students to benefit more students, while the first GEP selection test will still be carried out.# Why is this a problem?Gifted students are now forced to undergo the same standard curriculum that bores them to the core, disallowing them from actually reaching their potential. If that wasn't bad enough, guess what bored students do? They find ways to entertain themselves. Some might be self sufficient in their entertainment, while others act up in ways that would hinder the learning of the other 39 students in the class. Recently, the Primary school syllabus has also changed. It has become more open-ended and self-exploratory due to the buzzword ""hollistic"" 5-10 years ago when they started planning it. The concepts have also been getting more and more complex and packed, lessening the time available to learn each concept. Teachers are now more of facilitators, and facilitating the self-exploration and inquiry of 40 students is extremely impossible given the packed curriculum. You just can't cover every student with the time you have.Note that none of what I've said above would be too much of a problem for a gifted student. They'd still be snacking on the standard curriculum like a bag of chips. Now in a class of 40 students, the gifted student would not get enough mental stimulation and get bored (and maybe act out). Or the teacher could engage the gifted students while the rest of the students get bored because it's out of their depth and act out. It's already difficult to engage HA students with the normal curriculum, much less a gifted one. Of course it's not an absolute, but you'd get the idea. **MOE has admitted that there may be “**[**some reduction**](https://www.todayonline.com/news/gep-revamp-students-pupils-high-ability-programmes-pri-3-pri-6-2478901)**” in the intensity of enrichment as compared to the current GEP**>higher-ability learners will be “adequately engaged” and “hoslistically developed” through school-based programmes. So consequently, they won't be ""adequately engaged"" and ""hollistically developed"" through the standard curriculum. This dumbed down revamp is basically the *removal of the GEP programme*. **There will still be better schools with regards to ""GEP"" even though there aren't any GEP schools anymore**The current GEP schools would have the resources and specially trained teachers to beef up whatever after-school programmes they already had, but non-GEP schools will not have specially trained GEP teachers nor the years of experience and resources available. **The GEP programme wasn't only about academics**Former [GEP ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ey71wx/comment/ljbk5a5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)students ([both ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ey71wx/comment/ljbb2zh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)on [reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ey71wx/comment/ljc2qxx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)and news articles) have [attested ](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gifted-education-programme-gep-revamp-students-parents-concerns-4558096)to a [few ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ey71wx/comment/ljc7r69/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)observations.1. Smaller class size - As much as OYK wants to cherrypick studies that show increased class sizes don't help, they do. Otherwise why would GEP classes have almost half the normal number of students?2.

It’s also a special needs programme.”>A 2005 study of former GEP students found that some have trouble coping and are ostracised by their non-GEP classmates.>Recalling his days in GEP as being “both good and bad, socially speaking”, Dr Johannis said: “Kids can be cruel. There was a fair share of admiration, as well as resentment and some amount of rejection.>“This is why having friends with a common experience can be valuable and people who are more accepting of you,” said the 44-year-old, adding that he made many lifelong friends from his days in GEP.**MOE is being deliberately** [disingenuous ](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/all-primary-schools-have-teachers-specially-trained-to-teach-high-ability-learners-moe)**in saying that ""All primary schools have teachers specially trained to teach high-ability learners"" to back up their programme revamp**For one, GEP teachers were specially trained to handle the intellectual, emotional and behavioral needs of gifted children. Secondly, MOE is refusing to admit that the top 1% of gifted children are not the same as the 7% of HA students. The problem isn't about having suitable after-school programmes, because schools have had these programmes for years. The issue is with teachers being able to engage these gifted children in a class of 39 while executing the standard (boring and intellectually limiting) curriculum.The idea of inclusivity in the past decade has resulted in each class having more and more children with behavioral needs. Even when a child starts hurting other classmates, teachers' hands are tied because the schools will not dish out any proper consequence. Some primary school students have learning disabilities (can't even read or write or speak English at P6 level), but are still allowed to stay in mainstream schools. Teachers are already stretched thin, trying to juggle the increased amount of discipline issues brought about by these ""inclusivity"" outliers, and now they have to grapple with the prospect of having gifted kids who might act out in boredom, or go for hours of extra training courses.Without having time to even plan for lessons nowadays (due to nonsensical admin work), this might just be the final nail in the coffin for many teachers. (Hearsay, don't POFMA), that many teachers have left service in the recent years. Some schools are running skeleton crews with flexi-adjuncts making up as much as 20% of the teacher population. MOE might be begging ex-teachers to come back full time.    ^1 Introduced in 1984, GEP seeks to nurture “intellectually gifted students” and 1 per cent — or about 370 to 400 students — of each cohort are enrolled into the programme.     Right now, around 7 per cent of the yearly cohort attend such school-based programmes (after school programmes that cater to HA students).",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1f1kn7t/the_dissolution_of_gep_is_not_as_simple_as_it/

t3_1apf9lk,An Idea to Reduce Taxi Queue Times at Changi Airport,reddit,Transport,2024-02-13 08:03:00,0.8757,"So I had the fortune (or misfortune) of departing from Changi Airport Terminal 2 at 1AM this morning (13 Feb). As you can imagine, there was an influx of passengers via air, all returning from their holidays abroad or coming for their holiday, after escaping CNY with their families. All of them were seeking to catch a grab or taxi out of Changi Airport, myself included.My experience was unfortunate to say the least. I joined the taxi queue at 1, and only got my ride at 01:53AM (according to my taxi receipt). When I joined the queue, it was only half the length seen in the picture. It doubled and kept growing as I was leaving. Everyone was also trying to get a grab at the same time and nothing was working. You’d see one victor escaping the queue but that was few and far in between.It's not an ideal experience, especially when you're a visitor, arriving to see the famed Singaporean efficiency, only to be greeted with an hour long wait for taxi. It's one of the first experiences you have as a tourist and does set the expectation for the rest of the trip. This got me thinking, don't we have data that we can use to predict passenger volume and groups. Using the data of passengers arriving, we can figure out how many taxis and grabs are needed, coordinate between the transport companies to ensure adequate supply and that wait times are manageable for a grumpy passenger arriving after a long flight. There might be some incentivisation problem (how to entice the drivers to come) but we can use data to improve the experience.any other ideas that you can think of?",https://i.redd.it/jv7n392ju8ic1.jpeg

Just encountered this today and often. Instead of stopping properly at the bus stop, the bus driver stops at the location as shown in the picture (the bus in the picture has stopped and is not moving), even though there were no buses in front. The commuter who alights out of the bus ends up alighting outside the bus stop and commuters waiting at the bus stop have to walk over to board the bus. I’ve seen many bus drivers who appear to do this deliberately stopping far away from waiting commuters at the bus stop. Is this reasonable practice, as it sometimes feels like bus drivers are low-key pranking the waiting commuters by making them rush over to the bus (especially inconvenient for the elderly and less mobile)?",https://i.redd.it/v8713gycdnid1.jpeg

t3_s4kdva,For those that want tips on how to cope with depression or want to know what Singapore's mental healthcare system is like,reddit,Healthcare,2022-01-15 13:31:00,0.9979,"Hey all. 20M Singaporean here, have been coping with depression for the past 3 years. Here are some ways that helped me cope. I will just get straight to the tips, if you are interested in my back story or want to know the process of getting referred to IMH to read on.If you don't want to read this, here's the most important part. **You can only rely on yourself.**Tip 1: Don't rely on friends.Don't get me wrong, you can talk to your friends about your troubles and spend time with them to distract yourself. At the end of the day, you can only help yourself. They will not be there for you forever and friends come and go. They wouldn't want to keep someone who always talks about negative things around them.Tip 2: Listen to music.I'm sure we've all done this; lying down on your bed, staring at your ceiling and overthinking. Play some music. Just be sure not to play any music that's associated with bad memories. Finding new songs or genres of music really lifts your mood and gets your mind off the painful thoughts.Tip 3: Learn an instrument.I know this isn't for everyone but learning a new instrument can help pass time. Seeing your effort come to fruition is really satisfying and honestly makes you feel a lot better.Tip 4: Play with your pets.I'm sure there are some scientific studies that show that playing with your pets can help improve your mood. I didn't really look it up but personally it really helped.Tip 5: Take walks or just relax outdoors alone.Going out to the beach or somewhere quiet is really refreshing, especially after spending all that time cooped up in your room. You can bring your instrument along as well :).Tip 6: Talk to your parents.I know this may not be an option for everyone out there, but if you are lucky to have this as an option then please do so. Some parents may not understand what you are going through, but at least you're not bottling up everything. If you can't talk to your parents, try finding a psychologist (which is pretty hard here in Sg).Tip 7: Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.Having a drink now and then and crying really helps. But don't overdo it on the drinking, you'll only develop dependence, and same goes for the drugs (obviously).For those that are lucky enough to have not experienced depression, this is what it's like. Everyday waking up seems like a chore. You don't have motivation to do the simplest things like washing up or eating. You just want to lay in bed and close your eyes. You don't look forward to anything, not even your hobbies or playing games. You just don't have to will to do anything. You lose appetite, you want less human interaction and you just feel like fucking shit. I'm writing this to help those of you out there that feel the same way.Okay, now that I have laid out the groundwork for what I'm going to say, here is how I've learnt these tips. If you were just here for the tips you don't have to read on, but if you are interested on how the mental healthcare scene is in Singapore I will touch on that.I'm going to make this short, so I don't catch myself ruminating about my bad times. I was left out and bullied in secondary school leading to super low self-esteem. Was never invited to birthday parties or anything of the sort, not even hangouts at the nearby mall. I was lucky enough to be oblivious to how I was being treated by my ""friends"" though, so I don't think this played a huge part in my circumstance.Entered polytechnic, found my first actual group of friends and a girlfriend. We broke up shortly after getting together, later found out that she cheated on me with her ex. Being young and immature I started spiraling downwards into depression, drinking everyday, self harming etc. Lost interest in everything, basketball, studies, going out with friends, everything... Now that I look back it was really stupid of me. Almost jumped off a 25-storey building, later found out that my ex and her bf were making fun of me on social media for doing so. Fast forward about half a year later, found a new girlfriend and felt a lot better. My group of friends started falling apart because of small little arguments, only hung out with one or two friends. When I saw that the relationship was failing, started getting depressed and doing the same stupid things minus the suicide part. And to top it off, I fell out with my only friends in poly. Soon after, I broke up with my gf. I had no friends, no girlfriend. I decided to apply for deferment, which in my case was around 4 months or 1 semester. I went to see the doctor to get referred to IMH for depression. I'll touch on this part later, it's pretty important and i'm sure some of you are wondering what it would be like to be referred to IMH.During my deferment I thought it was a good idea to reconnect with my old secondary school friends. Everything was cool for the first month or so until they started to drift. I saw them as a distraction and it worked well while it lasted. Nobody really cared about how I just broke up or how I was feeling down 24/7. Soon after, I made some friends who were honestly of bad influence, started taking drugs and the sorts. After I cut everybody off, I went back to school, alone. As a retainee, nobody talked to me, I just went to school, sat through lessons and went home. It's pretty sad but I was fine with it.Here is where I tell you what I've learnt. Friends are a great distraction and nothing else. You can't rely on them, you can only rely on yourself. Sure, you can tell them about your problems, cry to them or spend time together. But at the end of the day, **you really have to reflect on yourself and stop moping around.** They have their own lives too, and they can't always be there when you need someone even though you were there for them when they did. Whenever any one of my friends was feeling down, I would drive over to their place and give them company. I did this countless times. But when I really needed somebody, no matter who I called, nobody would pick up. Nobody would care that I was feeling down. I don't blame them, I just wish that I cared about myself more. Now I wonder why I spent so much time and effort caring about others when really I should've been taking care of myself, though it would've been nice if they reciprocated. Don't get me wrong, you can cry and talk to your friends as much as your want, but don't expect anyone to be there for you when you really need someone, even for those who claim that they care. Friends come and go, that's just how it is.After realizing this I decided to cut contact with everyone, except those that were still worth talking to.Yes, it is lonely. Very lonely. Most of the time I would wake up with no notifications on my phone, no one talking to me, no one asking if I wanted dinner that night. I don't even have friends to play games with. But I've been caring for myself, making sure that I'm setting myself up for the future, when I actually enter adulthood.One more thing. Sure, you can smoke or drink, but do so in regulation. Trust me, if you drink yourself to sleep every night, your depression will still be there when you wake up.I abused K2 and weed because I had no one to spend time with. I had no friends, so I would go out alone and take drugs to relax and enjoy my alone time. Luckily for me, I didn't take anything more serious and it was just a phase. Once I stopped taking them and faced my problems straight up, I didn't want to go back to taking them. Although it does help you relax and get rid of your problems, it's only temporary. And it could lead to drug addiction. Nobody wants that.Okay here's the more interesting part. Singapore's mental healthcare. Here is what I did to get referred to IMH. I may not remember everything in detail. I went to a private clinic and told him I was showing symptoms of depression. He would write a letter and then you would go to a polyclinic to have a psychiatrist have a look at you. If they think that you should be admitted to IMH, then they would write another letter and you would have to take it there. This process takes around 3-4 months. If I remember correctly, you have to go for multiple assessments. Meaning that they would ask you the same questions as: ""How is your mood? How is your appetite? Have you lost interest in your hobbies?""The sad thing is that these psychiatrists aren't there to listen to your problems and give you advice. They are just there to assess you. Once you go through the multiple assessments, they will schedule an appointment for you at IMH. The waiting time is at least 1-2 months. During your first appointment, the doctor has access to the information that they collected from the assessments, and they will prescribe antidepressants. You have to return every 7 weeks (I think?) to refill your medication. And yes you have to pay, I was on 3 different types of medication at one point, each visit would cost me about $200. The sad thing is that throughout this entire process, unless you see a private psychologist costs $300+ per session, they will only refer you to one after your first appointment at IMH. And then you have to wait at least another month or two for your appointment. So throughout this entire 6 month-ish process, they only assess you and give you medicine. In other words, they just do their job. There is no therapy whatsoever. I didn't bother to go for the psychologist appointments because they just took so long.And here is another story to top it off. There was a period of time, quite recently in fact, where I was really down in the dumps and felt like I was going to do something stupid (off myself), so I drove to IMH A&amp;E to talk to a doctor or something. I understand that there are people out there with schizophrenia or more serious mental problems, but when I went there and told the front counter that I was afraid that I was going to do something dumb, I had to wait at least 3 hours before being able to see a doctor. You had to wait at the waiting area for 3 hours. I just took more drugs lol. Not even IMH A&amp;E can help you, unless you are willing to wait 3 hours or more, but if you're suicidal I don't think you would wait 3 hours.I've stopped taking the medication for about a week now. I do not have friends to rely on, I only have myself. I know hearing me saying you can only rely on yourself is sickening but trust me, take care of yourself. The only people that will take care of you are your parents or your maybe your significant other. Not even IMH cares.If you have any questions do leave them in the comments :).Edit:Thank you all for the comments and suggestions.

t3_1aw4js6,Proposal: Subsidised tertiary education for NSmen,reddit,Education,2024-02-21 13:50:00,0.9782,"I've been thinking about this issue: how do we make NS more equitable for the people who served. Two years of your prime life taken away, that's a huge setback. Plus, the local sg culture has relatively made light of the sacrifices of given NSmen, compared to other forced conscription countries like Korea or Taiwan or Thailand. Singapore is already well on its path to becoming a country that's 60% non-citizens, open to talents and labor competition from all over the world. It's what keeps out economy rolling and growing. However, all that is built on the foundation of men who served and sacrificed their time and even lives. Rumblings of discontent are inevitable, when the scales of fortune are tipped against their favor. What are we in Singapore? Security guards for the rich? We need to take steps to make things right. This is where subsidised education comes in. Education is one of the best forms of uplifting one's financial situation in life. To equip the youth with skills and knowledge they can use. To support them in this pursuit. I'm not even pushing for 100% free, knowing the out cries that will come. I'm saying let's consider it. Let's consider our budget and see how much we can subsidised. This is a first step in a long term consideration of truly recognising NS and making Singapore a home for everyone, rather than a forced labour camp for some and a playground for the elites.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1aw4js6/proposal_subsidised_tertiary_education_for_nsmen/

t3_s53i4v,Legal basis for rent reduction due to poor quality?,reddit,Legal,2022-01-16 04:30:00,-0.0772,"We're a bunch of exchange students who rent out a condo to live in. When we arrived, the whole apartment wasn't cleaned, the fridge wasn't even emptied. The contractually agreed upon kitchen utensils did not exist. The washing machine and dryer were broken to the point they were unusable. There's mold all over the bathrooms and ants coming out of the bathroom door. We couldn't use half the condo's facilities because the access card application is so long drawn out and unnecessarily complicated. The landlady and agent have been rather unresponsive and unfriendly throughout the whole process. And to top it all off, all three elevators were broken for a while a few days ago.We did get them to send a cleaner after one of our mate's SHN finished, but there's still mold and a lot of fat and grease up in the extractor hood to the point this might constitute a fire hazard. We went to IKEA and bought kitchen utensils that we'll subtract from the rent with the landlady's agreement.Still, we did not get what we paid for at all during the first two weeks of our contract. Yes we had a guy in quarantine, but all of the matters should have been fixed before we moved in. Ants are still there and so is the mold. I tried searching online if we have a case to simply pay less rent, sort of a forceful rent reduction. I know it is a thing in Germany and France, but during my research I found pretty much nothing on tenant protection here, I guess there aren't a lot of people who rent. What I did find is that it's a thing in Australia as well, so I'm assuming this sort of legal basis exists in the English legal system, which I assume the Singaporean one is based upon. But as you can see that's a lot of assumptions and not a lot of knowledge.We would appreciate it a lot if someone could share their knowledge on this topic and help us out.Do let me know if this is the wrong place to post / ask.

t3_1929jah,Why I feel that SimplyGo is very inconvenient and Nets Flashpay should not be discontinued,reddit,Transport,2024-01-09 15:55:00,0.9641,"With the announcement of the discontinuation of Nets Flashpay for paying bus and MRT rides, I want to voice out as to why I find simplygo a hassle. Source: LTASG’s instagram post dated 9/1/2024, as at the time of posting, it was announced about 2-3hrs ago.The advantage of simplygo is that it allows mobile topup and checking of balance, however, I find way too many issues with the system which is why I switched to nets flashpay.For context, I switched to simplygo because the staff said I could get $2 rebate. Then, I had to keep using app to check. One fine day, the entire simplygo system went down - I can’t check balance on app AND I couldn’t even topup my card at the topup machine. I ended up using nets flashpay and when I learnt nets flashpay is going to be no longer allowed, I’m very disappointed.First issue with Nets flashpay is that you need mobile data to check balance, if for any reason the network is down, you need to go to ticket machine to check. This can be a problem if you don’t auto-topup like me. Thankfully I live near MRT. However, I need to keep checking and looking at app just to ensure I have enough if I want to ride bus so that I don’t realise I have not enough and need go MRT station topup/pay cash.Second problem is this - how would I know if I got properly tap in/out (applies to bank card as well)? If I walk to the gantry and the person infront use simplygo, and then I tap and gate remains open, I can only assume I tapped in. Unlike nets flashpay, if I tap in/out, I confirm will know that I successfully tap card unless the person infront hv the exact same balance and pay the exact same fare as me. I like the 2000s era ezlink card system which is still being used in nets flashpay cards, I know how much I left after a ride and I can just go and topup instead of guessing how much I have in my card and I’m basically left being reliant on a system that if it is down or network is down, it is back to the 2000s where I need to go to the machine to check. Given that based on ltasg’s instagram post stating that “simplygo transactions are processed backend”, my suggestion is to just reconsider and not discontinue nets flashpay “because two in three adult fares are made with simplygo or bank cards” for the convenience of users who still want to see their balance. Moreover, if a system outrage happens on the simplygo system AFTER the discontinuation of nets flashpay, how am I supposed to pay for my ride if I can’t topup? Pay cash fares or use bank card? In this case I might as well use bank card instead of simplygo?I completely do not agree that nets flashpay should be discontinued just because at least 67% switched payments. In the end, this should still be left as an option just like how one ticket machine still accepts cash topups (although honestly, why can’t it be improved so that ALL of the machine accept cash but that’s a discussion for another day).",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1929jah/why_i_feel_that_simplygo_is_very_inconvenient_and/

t3_18f6vi8,LTA needs to acknowledge the capacity issues plaguing the NEL and CCL,reddit,Transport,2023-12-10 16:11:00,0.9871,"This is a long post so strap in:Basically, as it stands, CCL and NEL crowding is at a critical level, and the LTA refuses to acknowledge that this problem even exists. They have tried some solutions (for the NEL), but it's far from enough compared to **infrastructure improvements made directly to the lines**. Without their acknowledgement or action, this problem will only worsen as Singapore (and especially the NE region) densifies.Let me explain everything in that above statement:# 1. Why are these 2 lines in particular the most acutely overcrowded?It may come as no surprise to those who commute during the peak using these 2 lines, but waiting 3 or 4 trains has become the norm at certain stations like one-north, Buona Vista, MacPherson, Tai Seng, Hougang, Kovan and Little India. Even barring that, CCL and NEL trains are usually significantly more crowded than their counterparts on other mature lines NSL and EWL. As it stands, the NEL is the only line to serve the (now) ultra-dense districts of Sengkang and Punggol. Both have grown to be significantly more dense than the town planners could have ever hoped for (just look at Waterway Point on any day, really), causing the NEL to exceed ridership forecasts by large margins every year. And with new districts like Northshore, Fernvale or even Buangkok Cres coming up over the next few years, ridership is only set to increase by that much more.The CCL really just has 1 major flaw - it is a 3 car line that serves districts that deserve 6 car trains. Areas like one-north, Science Park/NUS, Tai Seng and even National Stadium are major commercial trip generators which have progressively built up since the opening of the CCL and are continuing to be built today, causing crowding to slowly build and reach the levels that we are at today. This is without even including the connectivity role the CCL plays, being basically the only option for trips from the west (Tuas/Jurong industrial areas) and southeast (Paya Lebar, Bedok) to the aforementioned NE (dense residential).# 2. What has the LTA done in an attempt to relieve overcrowding?Despite not acknowledging the issue explicitly, the LTA has implicitly acknowedged that this is urgent, as they have attempted several things to relieve crowding issues on these 2 lines.a. New trainsThe C851E batch of trains is the first new batch order of trains that is solely for line capacity increase since the 2012 order for the C151B (the C151C was ordered to complement the CBTC resignalling). They are hoping that the C851E will do the NEL and CCL what the C151B did to the NSL (prior to the C151A/C151B, NSL users were also waiting multiple trains before boarding). For the NEL, this brings the line capacity from 33,000pphpd to 38,000pphpd translating to a 15% capacity increase. For the CCL, this brings the line capacity from 16,000pphpd to 22,500pphpd translating to a 40% capacity increase.b. City Direct busesEver stood along Shenton Way during peak hour and see the neverending lines of 6XX buses going to destinations like Buangkok, Anchorvale, Hougang and Punggol? It's no surprise that basically every NEL station has a separate city direct service, and that every one of such services is now run using a high capacity public bus instead of a 40 seater coach. However, even these buses are limited in what they can do, as they are subject to congestion along CTE/KPE, and each bus can only carry around 140 if packed to the brim, compared to even 1 NEL train that can carry close to 2,000. c. Travel Smart JourneysLTA has introduced and expanded the TSJ programme in recent years. Its explicit aim is to decongest the NEL during peak hours. However, its utility is limited as similar to the City Direct buses, each bus can only carry so many people, and with a lower frequency that makes it even less able to reduce the congestion on the NEL****You may have noticed that many of these schemes target the NEL. That's because crowding on the NEL is highly directional. It's towards the city in the morning and away from the city in the evening. This makes planning alternative transport easy. However, the CCL, being circular, has no real start or end to the crowds. It's quite clear that the two headline stations for the CCL are Bishan and Serangoon, but beyond that, it's not easy to plan effective bus services for the CCL, which makes finding other alternatives even more important. # 3. Why is a solution so desperately needed for the CCL and NEL?a. The MRT system as a whole is bursting at the seamsNotice how every time there's a disruption the recovery plan always seems to be absolutely terrible? That's (unfortunately) a result of under-forecasting for ridership. Our MRT system has woefully limited redundancy and won't be able to cope with disruption of a major line. With the recent TEL woes, the other lines (mainly NSL) have mostly been able to absorb the extra passengers as the TEL at peak isn't really full, and trains are only half as often as on the NSL and 2/3 as long. Now imagine if the NSL had a fault on the scale of the rail crack discovered at Promenade recently. Areas such as Bishan, AMK, Lorong Chuan and Seletar will now cram onto the already overcrowded NEL > CCL causing even more headache for the already weary commuters for those 2 lines. Couple that with the bus route ""rationalisation"" (read: cuts). While such major disruption is now (thankfully) rare, it doesn't mean that it won't happen again, and underpreparing for such events will just lead to each incident becoming more and more unmanageable.b. The demand generators on both lines haven't stopped expandingThe aforementioned demand generation areas, especially one-north, Punggol and Marina Bay, have been expanding rapidly over the past few years, and it shows no signs of stopping. Without a clear plan to increase capacity beyond just adding new trains (which can be flawed, see below), the 2-3 train wait could easily turn to 5+ trains, which would seriously turn away commuters from public transport and turn more commuters towards already congested (and pollutive) roads like Serangoon Road (NEL) and the ORRS (CCL).c. Adding new trains isn't infinitely scalableThe new C851E order pushes both the CCL and NEL fleet basically to capacity. If every train is deployed on the lines, headways will be around 2mins at peak. Even at current 2min40-3min frequencies, there is already regular bunching at major interchanges like MacPherson, Caldecott and Buona Vista. Without a corresponding plan to reduce dwell time (time stopped at each station using techniques like closing doors faster or stronger deceleration), the signalling system will be the limiting factor anyway, thereby rendering the extra trains moot.# 4. Is the CRL going to solve this problem?NO! The CRL will defintely help, but the manner which it can is extremely limited. Imagine you work at Fusionopolis, and you live at Sengkang. Would you take a train from one-north 40mins to Sengkang, or hop on a 20min 74 bus ride to SIM/NP, take a 30min ride to Hougang followed by another 20-30min bus ride? The CRL will relieve some demand from commuters travelling from Tuas to Punggol, but those using the Circle Line from Kent Ridge, one-north and Buona Vista (the 3 main groups anyway) will not switch, ever. The CRL may also help by pushing commuters at Tavistock and Serangoon North onto the NSL when they currently use the NEL, but even that effect is limited given the majority of commuters are from deeper into the NE region.# 5. So what can be done then?Instead of trying to chip away at demand by skirting around the lines, why not get at the heart of the issue - the line capacity itself. Given that, the most appropriate solution would be to lengthen the platform and extend the trains. Both the NEL and CCL were built with significant length platform overruns, allowing a 4 car train to stop straight at almost every CCL station (barring a few like Promenade) and a 7 car train to do the same on the NEL. To push it further, select stations (like Bishan, Chinatown and Serangoon) and probably accomodate 5 and 8 car trains. LTA can consider employing SDO (selective door opening) to safely manage door operation, meaning at some stations, the first and last doors will not open. This will make the car ends less crowded, incentivising those travelling between the ""long"" stations to use these areas of the train. Upgrading every train to 5 and 8 cars can increase line capacity by 67% and 33% respectively, which coupled with the extra trains, can solve the capacity issues in the medium term.This isn't some new or novel idea either. It has been done before. Both London's deep level tube lines and Hong Kong's MTR have successfully attempted platform and train lengthening, with Hong Kong's Ma On Shan Line doubling from 4 to 8 cars before merging with the WRL to become the Tuen Ma Line.That doesn't mean it can be done quickly. Similar projects have taken between 4-6 years between project announcement and completion. This means that even if the LTA were to announce it today, we would likely only see results between 2028-2030. But for LTA to even get started, they would have to acknowledge that this is a problem, and I'm not sure that's going to be the case for a while. So until that changes, we have to live with bad and worsening crowding on the CCL and NEL.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/18f6vi8/lta_needs_to_acknowledge_the_capacity_issues/

You can find the preliminary labor figures at [https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/labour-employment-wages-and-productivity/latest-data](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/labour-employment-wages-and-productivity/latest-data).

Between Dec 2021 and Dec 2022, the labor force grew by 146,600 workers. And this does not even count foreign domestic workers! If we include FDWs, then the total rise in employment over 12 months is a quarter million (or a 6.9 percent growth Y-o-Y), the largest ever in Singapore's history in absolute numbers. This even exceeded the 2007/2008 numbers (as can be seen in the below chart).  [Screenshot taken from https:\/\/tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg\/table\/TS\/M183901.

There was a massive labor force surge in 2022, the largest ever in Singapore's history. What the hell was MOM thinking? If you expand the labor force by 6.9 percent within a year, then you will get a ton of inflation. What is worse is that the 6.9 percent growth in employment level only translated into a 3.8 percent growth in the economy (MTI preliminary estimate [here](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/01/Singapore-GDP-Grew-by-2_2-Per-Cent-in-the-Fourth-Quarter-of-2022-and-by-3_8-Per-Cent-in-2022)). This means that the marginal productivity growth from the labor force growth is already *negative*.

And idt there's much the government can do about it",reddit,Employment,2023-10-22 09:44:00,0.9778,"HOOK  We've all heard or actually experienced the FT phenomenon: when specific nationalities intentionally curry favour with superiors or with management, as opposed to actually being of value to their job scope, department, or company-at-large.  LINE  The trouble really begins when superiors/ management falls for their schtick. It's not enough they get promoted beyond their technical or management ability. It's not enough that immediately in these positions, they start passively/ unconsciously or even intentionally undermining or alienating the locals.  SINKER  It's when they are, in time, given direct or implied managerial responsibility over local peers, and/ or over hiring/ vetting applicants, or being part of interview panels. In certain sectors, that's the death kneel. What may seem to be inadvertent or unintentional will soon turn out to be intentional; only applicants of their nationality passes the vetting processes or interview phases and get hired. This is especially so in companies gat are establishing regional HQs and thus mass hiring. These periods of corporate hiring clamour can last from as short as 8 months, to 16 or even 20 months.  By then, entire departments are overrun with certain nationalities. And certain nationalities are so overtly nationalistic that they begin to insist upon certain rights by the logic of ""there are so many of us, Singapore should adapt culture to include us"".  My first specific example would be Pinoys. Few years back there was a mini fuss about some Filipinos were openly grumbling that Phillipines National Day should be a Singaporean public holiday, and that some of them insisted on displaying/ flying the PHILLIPINES flag during our own National Day.  My second specific example would be Indians. No doubt, some would have heard the expression Chennai Business Park. Which would not be an inaccurate observation if you just walk around the area at lunch. The problem is that the companies setting up shop in CBP are mainly using these foreigners for BPO purposes; Business Process Outsourcing. Better understood as customer service and backroom processes. Someone has to man the Tier 1 customer service hotlines. Someone has to run the IT departments, or whatever departments that specific industries designate as ""cost centers"" and thus look to get away with paying as little as possible while keeping specific essential functions inhourae for various reasons.  So what's the solution, really? Even the best solutions that come out of our manpower/ trade and industry politicians, particularly of the Phillip Yeo era cut of cloth, are ineffectual and ridiculous; Mah Bow Tan, Lim Hng Kiang, Lim Swee Say's ""faster, better, cheaper"", and the current iteration, Josephine Teo.   What's common in all of these politicians is that *none* of them have ever held a private sector role. All of them from 2G onwards, are public sector technocrats who have no real understanding of the insidious forces at play when it comes to private sector work environments. You have doctors, economists, an army general. But nobody actually from the private sector who has ever had to work their way up, even from middle management.  I am writing this to breathe credence and open a discussion into the notion that the fear , anxiety and actual phenomenon of being outflanked and pushed out of our jobs during regular economy downturns, when we are in our mid 40s, are very real. It breeds discontent and fuels the vitriol, rightfully so, since you have good workers or managers being replaced or retrenched, in favour of foreigners who focus on currying favour on bright sparkly projects as opposed to actually doing work and contributing value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17dpnvp/xenophobia_is_real_warranted_and_ultimately_the/

t3_1h2j8dj,A routine drive to work took a fatal turn when a mysterious explosion occurred and killed 1. Who was behind the Bedok Blast?,reddit,Public Safety,2024-11-29 18:49:00,-0.9942,"This File took a while to put together, but nonetheless it is quite an intriguing case**Moments before the Blast**Monday morning, 30 March 1992 started out as a normal day for Mr Wong Eng Meng. As he normally did, he would fetch his wife, Mdm Soon Ah Tin, to her workplace at Paya Lebar using his car, a brand new Nissan Presea.However, unbeknownst to either of them or the residents, the morning peace would be torn apart as the car mysteriously exploded when it started pulling out of the parking lot. The couple's last moments were noted in an account given by Ms Belen Villabar, a maid who witnessed them from a flat shortly before the explosion:>*""He (Mr Wong) unlocked the car. She (Mdm Soon) went into the car first while he stood outside to finish his cigarette. After he had finished, he got into the car and closed the door. He started the car engine. He reversed his car a little and it then it exploded.""*The force from the blast ripped apart the car's roof and shattered the windscreens, with debris being scattered 20m away and sent flying up to 8 storeys high. There was also a small ankle-deep crater (25cm by 13cm) on the concrete where the car was initially parked, and 2 surrounding cars in the vicinity were also damaged by the blast.Initial reactions from residents were mixed. One resident staying on the 9th floor had said that her block 'shook for a while, like a minor earthquake', while others had initially thought the blast was simply a bolt of thunder or a gas cylinder explosion. A former RSAF serviceman who was in the vicinity mentioned that 'the blast sounded like the kind of explosions we get in the army.'Mr Wong sustained hand and leg injuries from the blast but managed to crawl out of the wreckage through the window and attempted to help free Mdm Soon along with other bystanders. He was subsequently taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for further treatment (Changi General Hospital would only move to its present day location in Simei a few years later in 1997)Mdm Soon was less fortunate as the impact from the blast shattered her hips and ripped open part of her left arm. While she was initially conscious and able to vocalize her pain & request for help, she eventually fell unconscious and died before an ambulance could arrive. Her unborn baby could not be saved either. According to Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, one of the medical personnel who examined her corpse, the foetus had died before Mdm Soon did due to the proximity and impact of the blast.The blast also created an atmosphere of fear amidst the residents that this was the first of possibly more such incidents to come, which led to some of them refusing to speak to the media or be photographed for fear of their own safety.**Investigations**While additional officers patrolled the neighbourhood to reassure residents, bomb disposal personnel from the SAF and experts from the Department of Scientific Services (a Ministry of Health department which would eventually be under the Health Sciences Authority) searched the site. Fragments recovered from the scene were taken for further analysis and the charred remains of the car were stripped and scraped in an attempt to find any clues on the explosives and detonation mechanism.Attention was also turned to Mr Wong, who was interviewed by CID officers after he was discharged from hospital. However, he maintained that he had not received any death threats in the lead-up to the fateful blast. None of the residents interviewed by the police saw any suspicious activity around the car.**Findings**While it was never positively determined whether the charge was planted directly onto the car or placed beneath it, it was generally accepted that the blast was caused by a home-made improvised explosive device (IED) where the front passenger seat was. Detectives also believed that the IED was likely triggered by a mechanism akin to those used in booby traps rigged onto the car's tires, which would have set it off as soon as the car started moving.It was also ascertained that the car was last used the night before, which meant that whoever planted the IED would have had to do so in between when Mr Wong left his car for the night and his morning drive the next day. Despite the car being parked within 30m of a Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), the position of which the front of the car was facing meant that whoever planted it would have been hidden from any of the officers on duty at the post that night.Investigations also concluded that the blast was not an act of terror, but a targeted attack with the intent to kill, especially since Mr Wong had previously been convicted and fined for illegal moneylending in 1987 and 1988. This led investigators to believe that the attack was likely instigated by someone whom he had crossed paths with that had underworld connections. It was never fully established whether Mr Wong had returned back to his old ways after the previous 2 convictions**Unanswered Questions**The placement of the IED brought further questions as to who the true intended target was and the intent of the person(s) who planted the device. While Mr Wong had a sketchy past, the IED not being directly under his seat opened up another possibility that the blast was not intended to kill him, but to kill Mdm Soon instead as a way to send a message to him.Questions soon arose to the exact skill level of the perpetrator(s), with one school of thought believing that the person was a professional hit-man, while another view was that the person was potentially of unsound mind. Nevertheless, it was agreed that a certain level of technical competency was needed to have been able to put the IED together, and most importantly, there was a clear motive to kill.Yet another crucial question which remained unanswered was how the explosives used in the blast were obtained given the stringent conditions of their transportation, storage and use, as shared by an unnamed source familiar with the industry:>*""It's very difficult to pilfer explosives, whether they are for commercial use or even in the uniformed units, because of the extremely tight check-and-control measures""*Another industry source also commented the following:>*""It's done under very tight controls commercially. It can take weeks, if not months, to get approval for a big bomb-blast project.""*Officers from the CID, MHA and MINDEF launched a manhunt in an attempt to identify and apprehend the person(s) responsible for the blast in what a senior investigator said was 'one of the most concerted and high-profile investigation cases in recent years'. However, their identity was never ascertained, nor were they caught.**Sources**As the news coverage for this incident was done over multiple article in the same newspaper, I have grouped the articles based on the newspaper they were found in + the date publishedStraits Times 31 Mar 1992 - [Car bomb in Bedok kills woman and injures husband](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/straitstimes19920331-1.1.1)The New Paper 31 Mar 1992 - ['I saw thick smoke rising', Revenge motive for car bomb?](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920331-1.1.2),  [In a Flash](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920331-1.1.3), [How and Why, What blast witnesses say, Device is still a mystery, Man called insurance agent](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920331-1.1.6), ['I thought it was thunder'](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920331-1.1.7)Straits Times 1 Apr 1992 - [No death threats, say husband](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/straitstimes19920401-1.2.23.3)The New Paper 1 Apr 1992 - [We're afraid, say residents](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920401-1.1.2), [Baby could not be saved](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920401-1.1.6), [Bomb was ‘home-made’](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/newpaper19920401-1.2.13)The New Paper 2 Apr 1992 - [Massive hunt launched, Parking lot left empty](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19920402-1.1.2)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1h2j8dj/a_routine_drive_to_work_took_a_fatal_turn_when_a/

Having carefully considered the Joint Statement; I have repeated my call for the MAS to carefully scrutinise the proposed sale of NTUC Income to Allianz. The NTUC Joint Statement claims that the arguments in my first open letter are “not well founded” and “unfair”. I disagree. With respect, it is the NTUC Joint Statement that has got some key points fundamentally wrong. In my first MAS letter, I said that in receiving the 63 million extra shares at par value in NTUC Income (Income), NTUC Enterprise (NE) had committed not to redeem those shares in perpetuity. I also said that this commitment was fundamental to Income allowing NE to obtain the 63 million shares at par value (and not at the true value of the shares). The NTUC Joint Statement asserts that NE’s undertaking “was not for an indefinite period”. NTUC is seriously mistaken. I was the Group CEO of NE at the time. I recall clearly there were multiple meetings and discussions both at the NE and Income boards where this commitment was given by NE. Consistent with this undertaking, these shares were later converted into “irredeemable shares”. Full details are given in my second letter to the MAS. I have invited the MAS to ask both NE and Income to produce all the relevant board minutes and papers covering the discussions on the undertaking that was given by NE. MAS and the public can then judge the matter for themselves. 63 million Income shares were issued to NE at par upon that undertaking. When institutions give undertakings and assurances, both the letter and spirit of those undertakings and assurances must be honoured.If this sale goes through, NE as minority shareholder will have no power to ensure that Allianz, a for-profit corporation, will subordinate its own profit-making objectives to further NTUC’s social mission. The NTUC Joint Statement has not shown that Allianz has given a legally binding commitment to make NTUC’s social mission paramount over its own profits.Respectfully, the NTUC Joint Statement misses the woods for the trees.I sincerely hope the MAS will carefully scrutinise the proposed sale of NTUC to Allianz in the interests of Singaporeans.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ekj4a6

t3_tnn8yk,Strange scam involving leaked data (?),reddit,Public Safety,2022-03-25 14:33:00,-0.9429,"My legal name has the format [Surname] [Chinese name], [Western name]. This will be important. Yesterday afternoon I received a call from a +65 number. Knowing that it's a scam, I picked it up anyway to be greeted by a human speaking Mandarin, claiming to be from MOH, who addressed me using the format [Surname] [Chinese name]. This was especially interesting considering a few factors: government officials typically speak English and would address me by [Western name] [Surname], no one addresses me by my Chinese name because they **will** get it wrong the first try, and the scammer used my dialect surname instead of using the Mandarin reading of my surname. For this reason I use my Chinese name as a shibboleth because it is so difficult even actual Chinese native speakers might get it wrong the first try, meaning that friends no matter where they are from will always try to use my Western name. Even online my name formats are either [Western name] [Surname] or [Surname] [Chinese name] (,) [Western name]. So I went on the offensive by pointedly asking it ""What is my full name then?"" in Mandarin, but it kept dodging the question. After a lot of persuasion I managed to get my name spelt out *but without the Western name*. I kept telling it that the name is still incomplete and kept putting on the pressure to spell out my full name, because [Surname] [Chinese name] alone is not my full name. The scammer kept dodging the question until it lost patience and asked me if I wanted to hear it say my IC number, which made it even more intriguing. After accepting the challenge, the scammer said an IC number that actually got everything correct *except for one number*. And it's a number that would indicate which year I was born in. Now here's the question: assuming the IC number is actually scraped correctly but recited wrongly (the wrong number would have been invalid due to the wrong checksum anyway), how did they get only my Chinese name, yet not get my surname in Mandarin correct (meaning they did not get my name in hanzi). There's so much wrong with this scammer and I have to know where the data leak was coming from.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/tnn8yk/strange_scam_involving_leaked_data/

t3_188xb6l,Weekend musings: a proposal for a more equitable model of car ownership and usage in Singapore,reddit,Transport,2023-12-02 06:11:00,0.34,"This is an area that is close to my heart, an intersection between social equity and urban planning policies. I have an idea for what I think is a fairer, more equitable model for vehicle ownership and usage, and I'm curious if people agree or not - and I'd love to hear why it isn't feasible.I'll start with what I think the problems are. Firstly, the COE system is too blunt of a mechanism - while it is extremely effective at capping the number of vehicles that exist, it has a few drawbacks. It does not care about who ultimately is the recipient of that entitlement - whether it is a multimillionaire adding to his sports car collection, or a father of 2 who needs to ferry his kids to school before work. Secondly, the COE only limits ownership, not usage.For actual vehicular usage, we have to look at parking fees and tolls (ERP), as these directly ""tax"" (I use the term loosely) vehicular usage. Parking is easy to reason, it charges drivers for ""leasing"" land to store their vehicles. ERP tries to modify travel behavior by tolling usage of certain roads in certain directions at certain timings (corresponding to direction of rush hour traffic), and tolling drivers entering the CBD region. However, there are several problems here. Parking rates in Singapore are ridiculously under-priced as compared to other cities of similar standard of living, development, quality of life, etc. I would also argue that ERP tolls are disproportionately cheap compared to the cost of car ownership. Together, they are woefully inadequate at discouraging car usage; and combined with the high cost of car ownership, it leads to the emergence of the ""all-you-can-eat"" phenomenon, where car owners feel like they should use the car as much as possible (at low marginal costs) because they have already paid a huge upfront cost that last only 10 years.What this means is that car owners tend to be wealthy (to afford car ownership in the first place), and they are incentivized to maximize car usage (because of low marginal costs of using their cars).**2-pronged proposal:**1. Eliminate, or greatly expand the number of COE quotas, to drastically drive down the cost of car ownership such that it is attainable for most people.2. Drastically increase the cost of car usage in scenarios when there is the most cost to society.1) is pretty straightforward, owning a car should be within reach of most people. But to prevent the gridlock traffic and crippling congestion we see in other car-infested cities, car usage policies need to be reviewed and reformed.Consider the 2 following scenarios:1. An additional car on the road adding to the morning rush hour traffic on southbound CTE by a driver commuting to the CBD2. An additional car on the road at 10pm by a night shift worker commuting from Pasir Ris to JurongThese scenarios are not the same in terms of their cost to society. In the first scenario, the marginal cost to society of car usage is a lot higher than the second. Road capacity is fully utilized, every additional car causes congestion that delays the commutes of everyone else on the road. In the second scenario, the marginal cost to society is low, because there is low traffic anyway. Car usage policies should very strongly reflect the cost to society, and penalize the first scenario accordingly.I think a more equitable model of car ownership and usage would see a lot more people having access to cars, but also less usage at rush hours. There are a lot of legitimate use cases for cars (recreational activities involving transporting sporting equipment, ferrying children/elderly, running multiple errands all over the country, etc.) which should not be easily accessible only to a privileged minority. There are also a lot of negative externalities associated with car usage (air pollution, noise pollution, accidents, congestion, etc.) which should not be produced by a minority to be suffered by the majority. If we could reduce weekday rush hour traffic by taxing the hell out of driving during that time, and also allow way more people to be able to transport their bicycles to ECP to cycle on weekends, or visit out of the way locations like Sungei Buloh reserves, or even night shift workers commuting to their workplace in the middle of the night when public transit has stopped their services, wouldn't that be great?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/188xb6l/weekend_musings_a_proposal_for_a_more_equitable/

t3_17qk2n0,In response to a recent r/singapore post on how to increase ridership for new rail lines...,reddit,Transport,2023-11-08 11:59:00,-0.9251,"A while back on the more public transport-related side of r/singapore there has been one post in particular generating quite some buzz due to its highly controversial message. Unfortunately it came at a time when I was particularly committed elsewhere, hence this very late posting (the original post was published on 6th October 2023).[Link to original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/?share_id=e4osWcyr4HfMJLVRQAc5q&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=3)Nonetheless it contains much dangerous confusion in public transport discourse locally which we should be aware of and steer clear from. I am in no way implying the author (or OP as I will refer to) is out with any malicious agenda, but it is good to be aware of unhelpful thinking that doesn't improve public transport, and avoid it actively.To tl;dr the long 990-word essay that OP has typed up, he wonders why the TEL (and DTL), despite operating in revenue service its third stage already and currently serving the CBD, is still not ""performing as well"" as expected. There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form ""sucks"" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it's the case and suggest possible remedies. Unfortunately, this complex line of reasoning is riddled with fatally inaccurate assumptions, shaky logic, and prioritising the wrong things, which was why the long scholarly-appearing piece came off as offensive to many common folk who actually experience the system on a daily basis, and more critically ***rely*** on it in their lives.The entire issue of underperforming rail lines, while a factual reality, has been framed entirely wrongly by OP, from the very start of the piece.>Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents.Once issues concerning public transport (planning, operations, or management) are framed from the angle of revenue (or worse, ***profits***), the point of the discussion is lost, and further reasoning along this line of thought only digs a deeper grave for the OP. Public transport **cannot** be run like any normal business would -- outside dystopian levels of urban density the free market would simply not produce public transport service that would be of acceptable quality and quantity to us. To frame public transport issues predominantly as one of dollars and cents (as was described by one commenter on OP's post) misses the point, as well as the far more nuanced role that public transport plays in Singapore's society beyond just generating revenue for the government. To start off the post by quoting the TEL's farebox recovery rate **assumes** that public transport (*as a whole*) should be profitable on its own, when more often than not, the greater social goals of a connective transit system with abundant quality service often means otherwise. As commenters in the original post have rightfully called out the OP over, metrices of ""sustainability"" for a public transport system cannot be limited to just cost and revenue! Do you measure the benefits of healthcare and education in just dollars and cents? Yes, but such finance-based assessments in the real world examine the **aggregate** economic impact on the entire economy, rather than immediate costs and profits!First up, the OP needs to be realistic, especially when considering the situation of newer rail lines here. Unlike the older 6-car lines which almost entirely pass through dense HDB estates for a large majority of the route, the DTL and especially TEL do not nearly serve as much density. There is only so much you can do with hub-and-spoking the entire system around that single line serving lower density before the network structure gets very out of proportion, as the OP himself will demonstrate to great irony later. A chicken-and-egg relationship exists between service and ridership, but OP gets it just wrong. What is necessary to convince commuters to do a mode switch to ride trains? **Service.** You can build it, but if service fails to meet the mark (and being in Singapore, commuters have very high expectations for transit service), forget about getting riders on trains. If we wait until the TEL is completely full before improving service, OP basically says ""how about never"", given that the density along TEL makes it unrealistic to expect crush loading that necessitates better service. On the other hand, proactively improving TEL service would better convince existing bus riders, and motorists to switch. Mind you, the TEL is competing against highly robust bus services operating well enough during the peak to convince passengers to stay despite the opening of Stage 3 over a year ago.OP proposes that the recently-introduced Service 163B be extended to become a feeder for Lentor station on the TEL, in supposedly an effort to relieve the[ overcongested NEL](https://sgtransportcritic.wordpress.com/2021/04/13/2021-breakdowns/) by *diverting passengers from Sengkang to ride the TEL from Lentor*. Now, if the OP has actually pulled out an actual map, or even consulted (!!) Google Maps, it should be obvious that no rational commuter in their right mind would actually pick such a route over one that already exists for them in the north-east! Towards the city, queuing in line for a jam-packed NEL train is still twice as fast as detouring all the way to Lentor and boarding the TEL. Those heading north already have 161 and 965, which could be improved further but otherwise are robust options! For the same journey, one travels further and incurs additional time penalty. Who would willingly switch, unless forced to? Maybe if their destination was directly along TEL2, but for most cases 163 already provides a direct trip anyway.In a similar vein, the point of amending bus routes (at least, not until rationalisation became the key motivation for such) is to create a more interconnective overall network that incorporates, and acknowledges the ability of both modes to create a system that, to the best of its ability with resources available, provides fast, convenient and connective journeys for all. To make it clear, nowhere in the previous sentence implied ""forcing commuters to choose the train when a bus does the job equally well"", unlike what OP is implying with the example of Service 18's amendment to serve Tampines East station. Nothing's wrong with it, until its intent gets twisted out of context. In any case, numerous train disruptions over the past decade demonstrate that forcing people on trains is a foolhardy idea, despite the presence of additional parallel rail lines in recent years. Look no further than the NSL and TEL's interconnected breakdown streak this year.OP claims that ""long milk-run routes"" are *less reliable*, as if there was a correlation between bus route length and reliability, when truth to be told, there is none. Feeder services can throw you ridiculous bunching and clumping nonsense too when demand surges during the peak periods, as any resident in towns with ""dual-loop"" feeder services can attest.That aside, OP makes a truckload of confused and incorrect assumptions about buses and what they can (or can't) do, almost all of which are unfounded by a bit more international awareness. Unfortunately, these tropes also commonly heard elsewhere, so it's worthy examining them here.Perhaps the most fatal of them all that guides the bulk of the post was the notion that buses are *inherently* unreliable or inefficient, for no reason other than them being buses. It shouldn't be hard to see why this is patently false -- even our LTA's own efforts, however half-baked, shatter such simplistic caricatures of what buses should be like. Continuing the train of thought from above, OP claims *""bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these \[long trunk\] routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs""*. While subtle, it is an insinuation that buses inherently get stuck in traffic, and hence are definitely less reliable. This is also OP's favourite attack against buses in general if one reads his other works elsewhere on the internet -- ""buses get stuck in traffic, hence are less reliable and ***must be replaced by trains!!***"". Uh, nope. Heard of something called a ***bus-only lane***? I know Singapore doesn't have much of those (Bencoolen Street being the only working demonstration of this), but is this not a call to instead strengthen bus priority, rather than calling for their outright demise straight away...? Initiatives such as signal priority (the real one where the buses actually rig the signals) and dedicated bus lanes from around the world easily disprove OP's argument. Arguing in a similar vein that congestion forces bus operators to have to dedicate more disproportionately more resources towards trunk operations is also unfounded. Refusing to improve bus priority beyond current efforts afforded by LTA is an ***institutional*** issue arising from underprioritisation, not an ***intrinsic*** issue to buses as a transport mode themselves.Besides being stuck in the old mentality about buses, much confused talk from the OP shows he doesn't have any idea what he's going on about.May I present this big brain statement from OP:>Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal*How much do you hate buses, so much so that you think traffic congestion is caused by them???* Whether out of intellectual dishonesty, OP is missing the forest for the trees here. I seriously wonder if he actually thinks peak hour traffic congestion primarily consists for buses, from the way this argument was framed.  ü§Ø Also... *is it not during the peak period, where bus priority initiatives are at their most effective????* Recap: bus priority initiatives are oriented toward giving buses an advantage over cars in situations where the latter would be stuck, such as general congestion, or traffic junctions. What is the OP getting at here?In further confused talk, OP pits trains vs. buses in reliability to prove the superiority of the former. The big elephant in the room being missed here is that when talking about something as interconnected as public transport, reliability must be seen from a **system-wide** level, rather than on an individual line or mode level as OP implies. Having a part of the network being less reliable than the other due to institutional inertia does not help the reliability and resilience of the overall network, and results in worse outcomes for all, which runs counter to the spirit of building up the network in the first place.The fallacy of rail being inherently opposed to buses due to the mode type runs prevalent in the post, with OP claiming again, that because buses are buses and trains are trains, the latter can be automated while the former cannot, thus making trains even ""better"". Such a statement cannot belie OP's ignorance of bus automation projects around the world that have been ongoing for at least a decade, with the[ most recent demonstration in Scotland and Dubai](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/scotland-cavforth-autonomous-bus-project-stagecoach/) featuring the equivalent of a full-sized single-decker bus here, running autonomously with the crew only monitoring operations. With Singapore still choosing to put hostlers on ***every*** train on the automatic (GoA4) lines, the point on manpower savings is only as effective as the improved staff to passenger ratio a train gets compared to the buses it replaces, and when automation is so prevalent in future that no staff are needed on board throughout, OP's point is but moot.In his quest to argue for rail to replace buses as far as possible, OP demonstrates his lack of understanding of how buses work here, and how they're used. Ironically, his suggestion to break up long trunk routes into smaller segments goes against his own mantra of a hyper-efficient transport system, as two shorter routes will require marginally more resources to operate. Each end of a bus route typically requires 1 extra bus parked, for layover purposes, so breaking a long route in two means adding an extra set of buses laying over at two extra ends. There's also the issue of the city area having insufficient bus infrastructure to actually handle that many routes being split up into two, for the matter.OP then claims that ""shifting long-haul trips to the MRT"" would enable bus resources to be ""conserved"" for shorter trips. To translate the lingo into simple terms, OP advocates for a hub-and-spoke style public transport system, which has been demonstrated to be wildly inefficient in serving large areas with fewer resources, as the experiences of Woodlands and Yishun since the 1990s have shown. That aside, OP will do well to actually check ridership statistics of feeder services compared to those of trunk and long feeder routes, because if longer trips by bus constitute the bulk of all bus rides, then forcing them onto the rail network will not end well, especially with a rail line plagued by disruptions, already overcrowded rail lines, and rail lines built severely under capacity. Hell, I'll be generous and be willing to concede on this point if combined ridership of feeder and long-feeder routes exceed trunk service ridership!Let's look at some more word salad:>Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this.Based on what OP describes, the ""compact bus network"" in question is a hub-and-spoke one, almost entirely consisting of only feeder buses. Of course, if you deleted every trunk bus route off the map today, we'd suddenly find ourselves with an immense surplus of buses and manpower, and it would be even possible to make every feeder run at two-minute intervals! Yet despite such, ""bus passengers who don't touch the MRT"" would not benefit, simply because they no longer exist! In a hub-and-spoke transport system, there would be highly limited scope of public transport trips that would not involve going beyond each town, thus making the benefactors in this argument a very niche group that hardly travels beyond town boundaries...Picking the right arguments to make your stand is one matter (which OP fails at), and finding the appropriate examples to back up your claims is yet another. The international example chosen to support intensive bus cuts (Ottawa) is one of the worst possible, even within Canada. OP cites how Ottawa ""broke their bus-only system"" to accommodate the opening of their O-train light rail system, specifically how bus routes previously plying into the city were ""forced back to terminate at O-train stations"" to prevent ""congesting"" downtown terminals. Canadian readers looking at OP's post are dying from second-hand cringe, knowing full-well how[ the terrible implementation of the O-train](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-ottawas-lrt-didnt-go-wrong-it-started-wrong/?gad=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI48i_wI20ggMVwieDAx20JQoBEAMYASAAEgJbC_D_BwE) has resulted in worse ridership for public transport overall.[ While many Canadian cities saw transit ridership generally increase, Ottawa has been struggling to achieve this trend](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/drop-in-transit-ridership-has-officials-across-canadastumped/article30178600/). A more instructive vignette is to look at how it fares compared to Vancouver, which has only 60% the population. More importantly, their TransLink doesn't engage in the same drastic scaling down of bus services to favour rail service. Yet, Vancouver has three times as many riders on transit than Ottawa. OP probably hasn't realised that Ottawa's dismal ridership figures are a red flag that he isn't quoting an appropriate counter-example. This comparison is a demonstration that what really matters in getting people on public transport is ***not*** mode, but rather the quality of service. Ironically, this answers the initial question that guided OP's entire post -- ""how to get more people to ride new MRT lines?"" Well, improving TEL services proactively is a good start.OP further notes that Ottawa is a small city compared to Singapore, and thus if a smaller city gutters its bus network, we should as well right? To break his bubble, us being a larger city instead means that we have ***redundancy requirements*** that a smaller city would not necessarily need. And even so, given the amount of trouble Ottawa has encountered with their light rail system, they will do well to have it too.It's about public transport versus cars, as OP likes to say both on Reddit and elsewhere. He claims that since our public transport usage rate and COE prices are sky-high, it's difficult to convince motorists to switch. Newsflash: decimating the public transport network by converting it to hub-and-spoke and making trips by public transport more of a hassle is only making more people switch to driving instead, and of course, if they're getting that COE at all cost, it won't be given up so easily ***unless service improves sufficiently to convince them otherwise.*** The way OP wants to go about reworking public transport here only vindicates the choice made by these newfound motorists.Realism is a nice thing to have when looking at policy issues, but like all nice things, there isn't enough of it, and unfortunately it's not found in the OP's post either. He writes that the ""build it and they will come"" mentality is no longer applicable to new rail lines, and thus implies that ridership on newer rail lines must be ***forced*** (from cutting parallel bus routes, as has been done for the DTL twice in 2020 and 2021). OP should ask himself how much can actually be squeezed out of bus ridership before the detrimental effects of service cuts to the overall network structure does more harm than good in encouraging people to take public transport rather than drive. In a similar vein, the argument that the large-scale bus service cuts that were initiated from the MRT's early days up to the early 2000s should be continued reflects a lack of awareness of the current conditions of the system. With newer rail lines featuring smaller trains that max out at lower demand, bus cuts should be done minimally, only for routes that do not already have the ridership to justify themselves, nor a unique sector that cannot be served by amending other routes. This is not to say that we cannot ***reorganise*** the bus system -- we certainly can and should, but we must be conscious of the final outcome being a *net increase* in service, rather than a decrease, as is the case now.In the middle of his post OP brings up the name that almost every Singaporean now associates with the MRT -- Ong Teng Cheong. In the context of the arguments OP was making (he was arguing that buses were the cause of rush hour traffic), this appeal to authority is irrelevant, and stricter critics would find this a highly dishonest portrayal of Ong's legacy, where it should have been one of seeking constant reform, to fix what isn't broke before it breaks. Until we can cover every last inch of Singapore soil with rail, it is equally disingenuous to claim, as OP subtly implies, that rail rapid transit is the silver bullet for all of Singapore's public transport issues. For one, that would be a reckless waste of taxpayer money, itself a problem asking to be fixed.Since OP loves to view things from a money-minded perspective, here's a money-minded response to a money-minded take on public transport operational cost. Billions of dollars spent on ""underutilised"" MRT lines? According to the ADB, Singapore loses anywhere between[ 8 and 20 billion SGD](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/asia-s-cities-need-quality-public-transport) ***every year*** to traffic congestion. By comparison, that's how much an **\*entire\*** rail line costs here. Even the scary ""S$2.5 billion"" annual subsidy is insignificant compared to this, when you recall that this sum is how much is paid out to subsidise ALL train services, as well as all buses too. These rail lines are already paying for themselves from the day they commence revenue service, by reducing congestion on the road and saving the national economy the financial penalty of traffic! This is why it remains important to target motorists to induce a mode shift to public transport -- it is how these rail lines recoup their costs! A dozen billion saved every year from reduced traffic will sufficiently pay off the entire MRT network's construction cost within 10 years! Talk about improving service first, and the financial rewards will be more than proportionate to the extra sum invested.To OP, if you're reading this, no hard feelings bro, just helping you clarify confused public transport lingo üòä",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17qk2n0/in_response_to_a_recent_rsingapore_post_on_how_to/

See [https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/other-guides/guide-on-managing-and-notifying-data-breaches-under-the-pdpa-15-mar-2021.pdf)Can we expect to see some similar accountability on ACRA's part? Regardless of what the govt's future policy intent may be, we live in the present and surely ACRA's disclosure of NRIC data has to be evaluated based on the prevailing guidelines and status quo. Until the future policy intent has been fully operationalised, disclosure now compromises the data privacy and security of everyone whose full NRICs were exposed. I think it is high time for ACRA to come forward and explain just how many people were affected, how they decided on whose NRIC numbers to disclose (was it only directors and shareholders or were others included too), why they decided it was necessary to publish this database, how they ended up running ahead of future policy intent, whether they can track who accessed the NRIC numbers or could have scraped the NRIC data they made available, and what remedial actions they are now going to take. ""Sorry we ran ahead of policy intent"" doesn't cut it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hhim3r/govt_agencies_have_to_comply_with_comparable_if/

Claiming that I took advantage of Singapore. I don't know if their fierce ""love"" for their country is a common thing but geez, calm down. I truly valued my time here and worked really hard in my course. If you're just hopping on to say ""boo hoo, it's your fault"", move on. I am not asking for sympathy. I literally asked for advice, and received it, thankfully. I already explained myself in the comments below.&amp;#x200B;So I recently graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in Media &amp; Communication and I'm a Burmese national. When I was on Student Pass, I worked a few jobs with ease, part-time then full-time until the expiration of my pass. Now I have applied to more jobs and went to interviews that went really well until I see the interviewer's face drop when I told them I need a Work Pass. Instant no.The obstacle is...well, very inescapable and I'm constantly disappointed at the fact I may have gotten a job if it wasn't for my foreigner status.

And often the companies I apply to have no foreigner quota.I come here to ask for advice. What do I do? I cannot go home to Myanmar. I don't have the option.

t3_13izzci,This country's mental healthcare system is broken.,reddit,Healthcare,2023-05-16 09:15:00,0.9778,"To be concise, this post will only be about the logistical and practical issues in our mental healthcare system, not sociocultural factors influencing mental well-being in Singapore. I already sent a feedback form to IMH, so this is to update fellow Singaporeans about what the landscape is like.  1. **Public hospital: Uncontactable, no accountability, no patient-doctor relationship**  When you go to emergency services in IMH and their psychiatrist prescribes medication, they do not leave you with contact information for your psychiatrist. I experienced frightening side effects from the medication they gave me and had nobody to contact. The side effects were not mentioned in the information booklet they gave me. I called IMH, they could not trace my psychiatrist, and they told me to call the IMH pharmacy. I called and the person on the line could say nothing more than ""I don't know, anything about your medicine, you need to talk to psychiatrist."" (Like gurl, I know.) What are patients supposed to do if they have bad side effects? Is the only option to go to emergency services again? This lack of a patient-doctor relationship is harmful especially in a medical field that should be defined by continuity of care and an intimate understanding of a patient's mental state.  2. **Public hospital: Absurd waiting list**  The appointment slots they give you are 2‚Äì3 months away. This is unacceptable for people who are in crises or whose mental illnesses are episodic (i.e. people who are usually fine but have moments of great urgency.) A system should be able to accommodate both types of patients‚Äîpatients with chronic but stable illnesses and patients with time-sensitive issues (losing loved ones, suicidal thoughts, etc). Patients who cannot wait to see a psychiatrist will have to look for private care options, which brings me to:  3. **Private care: No information about Medisave-accredited clinics**  There is no information source about where Medisave can be used for mental health treatment outside IMH. There are only articles about how Medisave can be used for psychiatric conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) at public facilities or ""accredited medical institutions"", but no follow-up information about what these accredited medical institutions actually are. I found a clinic with a 2018 website update about how they were Medisave-accredited, only to find out after my appointment with them that they weren't. At this point, I don't even know if ANY private clinics are Medisave-accredited.  4. **Private care: No accessible information about cost**  Most private care websites do not have information about the cost of their services. You can only find out if you call them or if you visit their clinics in person. This is a huge waste of time for everyone involved. A patient should be able to compare prices and make informed choices for their mental healthcare. Psychiatric consultations are not cheap. They can set you back $400 a pop. We really need to know how much they cost before we make a decision.  5. **Online therapy alternative BetterHelp: Inconsistent, veering towards illegitimate**  This is not in our government's purview, but to give you an idea of what an alternative is like, BetterHelp has a dangerously lax definition for what constitutes a ""therapist"". Their ""therapists"" include counsellors without degrees in psychology who practice ""Reiki healing"", hypnosis, or ""crystal therapy"".I understand that we are not entitled to luxurious standards of care with psychiatrists and psychologists at our beck and call, and I understand that sometimes resources are stretched thin in medical infrastructure. What I find unacceptable is that **patients don't even have the information required to make decisions about their treatment**. If they accept that public care is too slow and want to pick a private clinic, they can't tell how much private clinics will cost, and sometimes they're given outdated and inaccurate information. Keep in mind that these patients are, by definition, not doing well mentally, and the more they need care, the harder it will be for them to navigate this confusing medical system. All this will probably be worse for disadvantaged communities, like Singaporeans who don't understand English, or people who don't have the time to do online research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13izzci/this_countrys_mental_healthcare_system_is_broken/

As you can see the space between the seats previously fit additional seats. Now commuters have to face each other in an awkward way, with legs touching each other on the bus??? Many commuters now don’t have seats to sit too because passengers often stretch out their legs making it super inconvenient to sit opposite them. People have to sit at an angle just to avoid touching each other (if they even bother to sit). People who sit facing the rear also have greater difficulty seeing where the bus is heading to and when they need to alight, or suffer from motion sickness. As a result the seats facing the rear are often unoccupied. What a waste of space and unnecessary change. It’s like whoever designed these doesn’t even take the bus? These seats were probably designed for families but how often do you see a family needing to sit like this? Is the change even necessary? Furthermore, as a result of this change, the seats at the front are bunched up as well. I’ve tried seating just in front of these seats and my feet couldn’t fit into the space.

The scammer asked me to choose which job I want, and said they will forward my contact to her boss.

As someone who was a landlord's rep and drafted more tenancy agreements than I can care to remember, most landlords prefer to stick to 1-year lease periods and the rental increases are looming very shortly.The people in my team at work are facing a ton of anxiety now. Most employers are not willing to offer raises to compensate for rental increases. It's very rare for employers to include rental support as part of their hiring packages. As a result I can ballpark 90% of my foreigner coworkers are preparing to resign and go home when their leases are done.3/4 of my interns are international students and this is hitting them particularly hard. Dorm rooms are not guaranteed even for international students and those students are staring down the barrel of increased rental eating up the budget they set aside for food. 2 of the interns are talking about transferring their credits to universities at home.This shit is serious.

In light of the death of SGT Raja alleged to be due to a toxic SPF working environment, I felt that I have to post this to let people know my experiences in SPF.  I am writing under an alias account to protect my identity. Let‚Äôs see if SPF would doxx me, in hypocrisy to their own laws.  This is a story about a broken employee grievance system, written to warn those considering joining this organization. This is my story of my experience in SPF. No names or sensitive information is shared in adherence to Official Secrets Act.  Whilst I was being posted to investigation branch, another department‚Äôs IOs warned me about the department I was being posted to. They talked about the toxic people and manager there. At that time, I didn't believe them.  As my police tours started, as seen on CNA documentary, I was in charge of handling phone calls on cases from NPCOs. My teammates would work on other tasks.  Going in fresh, I did not know what to expect. I asked my allocated mentor what I should look out for when picking up calls. He said, ‚Äòwhen you become more experienced you will know.‚Äô Later on, I asked if he could demonstrate how to handle the phone calls, he picked up one and demonstrated how fast he could handle a call and ended the call within 20s. There was no explanation that came after. This would be his modus operandi for many of his future 'teachings'. With this, I went on tours without the basic explanations on what I should be doing even when I asked.  During the course of my tours, I tried to ask my teammates on the tasks and cases, but many denied to share information and told me to ask my mentor instead. People were not forthcoming in sharing knowledge ‚Äì Knowledge that was essential to do my job.  In addition, there was no proper orientation. Every time I needed a document or resource to do my work, I had to go beg around for them. In contrast, other departments have starter packs with documents to get them started. Their teammates were forthcoming in sharing. I envied them.  As I naively believed that the phone calls were about speed, including making decisions as my mentor had demonstrated so, I tried to pick up all the phones calls that came during tour. As a result, I was overwhelmed.  I only found out much later that my teammates were supposed to help pick up the calls. But sadly, they did not inform me or offer to help. They certainly did not notice something was amiss when they were getting little to no calls. As a result, I was making mistakes in my work. I kept forgetting stuff as I got overwhelmed by calls during tours and outside tours.  As I made work mistakes during tour, some of my teammates began to say: ‚Äòif you don't know something, you must ask‚Äô. In my thoughts, I was thinking, I did ask but I get bounced around or get nonchalant answers except from a few people. This is just my bias, but I think in the private sector, people would know better. They would know that those with experience have to also play their part to share.  The repercussions are that during tour, I made some decisions and some did not work out. I then get blamed for them. Generally, there was a stance that did not tolerate mistake ‚Äì which one can argue to be both good and bad.  I raised the issue on my mentor to my manager. I told her in a nice manner that my mentor was not really teaching me the things I needed. Based on my impression, my manager talked to my mentor to take corrective action. At first, things seemed to get better, because my mentor would sit down with me to explain a subject that was essential for my work. However, this only happened once. The nonchalant teaching continued afterwards. If I did not ask, nothing is ever shared or taught. But to be fair to the manager, she did try to share some teachings. Am I supposed to know what to ask when the information is something that is privileged to those with experience? Work mistakes continued. With the overload in work, I continued to make mistakes during work, including typos. I was also blamed for not coping well.  Thankfully, there was a teammate who was kind enough to share the resources that his own mentor shared with him. If not, I could not even do my basic work.  However, as my work performance was not improving, my manager became more and more abusive. She became fiercer and fiercer in her interactions with me, sometimes shouting my name fiercely out from her room. Months later, she would also fiercely tell me to get out of her room and to leave her department. Hostile interactions continued as she gave a ‚Äòblack‚Äô face during our interactions, including when I greeted her in the morning. (The boss made all sorts of micro-aggressions too, not like she recognize them)  At some point, the narrative that I did not ask has become entrenched, even though 9 out of 10 times I can assuredly, based on my conscience, say that I did. I asked to the best of what I could, without the privileged information held by the mentors. (I was even blamed later for asking about everything. Just how self-serving can these people get?) Later on, I found out that my mentor was covering his ass by speaking poorly about me to my manager. Given that she is, in my opinion, a Machiavellian covert vulnerable narcissist who cannot take disagreement, it was clear that he was agreeing with her own views on my incompetence to protect his position.  One month in, I sat with my big boss to tell him that I wanted to change department. He dismissed my concerns, showing a lack of interest.  The next day, when I was back in the office, I was shocked when my boss angrily told me off for talking bad about her to the boss behind her back. Since when did sharing concerns about a manager become bad talking? That was when I knew that what I told my big boss was being conveyed to my manager. I still remember her saying fiercely: ‚ÄúI hate people who talk bad about me behind my back the most!‚Äù Given the fierce backlash from trying to raise an issue, one would be mad to raise issues to the big boss.  So I tolerated such a department. A few months in, when I finally found out that I was not supposed to take all the calls from NPCOs during AIO tour and told my manager, she blamed me for not asking. This blaming continued even though she said at the start with such gusto to me that there will be no blaming in this department, after making negative assumptions that I was blaming someone for a case that was passed down to me, that was not done well.  Deteriorating treatments continued, and my mental health deteriorated. I was getting dark thoughts. I sat down with my big boss while censoring my words on my manager and I was referred to PPSD for therapy. I knew this had to be done because I knew something would happen if I did not leave this department.  This time, it was my big boss who said, ‚Äòwhy didn't you tell me?‚Äô In my mind, I was thinking, you were conveying what I said to my boss, and it only leads to blaming and scolding. You think I would be able to tell you? I would only be shooting myself in the leg.  Nine months in, I was finally transferred to another department. I ceased my therapy then as the colleagues there were friendly, professional, and forthcoming with their sharing and I was able to do my work well. Some of the work is even more advanced than my previous work. At one point, I handed in a file that was well done to my big boss. There, he asked me, ‚Äòwhy is it that you couldn‚Äôt cope previously?‚Äô That was when I could confirm, he didn‚Äôt really care.  Whilst I was in the new department, the commander held a no supervisor chat with the employees. Before I went to the talk, I was clearly told to send the minutes of that chat to a supervisor, who was not supposed to be there. Ultimately, I did not send those minutes out to the unauthorized supervisor. But at the same time, I could not raise my issue or give my true feelings about the organization to the commander as that information could be leaked. I am sure my colleagues felt the same, given their lackluster response.  Ultimately, I decided to quit SPF, given how dysfunctional the organization was. There was no procedural justice or any effective form of grievance handling of verbally abusive managers.  One year later, I still get dark thoughts. During one such attack, I wrote in to a minister to look into the matter. Action was finally taken. Info was sent to the division‚Äôs feedback and IAO called me. I thought something was finally getting done. I thought that someone was finally going to recognize that there was a problem here.  What happened during the interview was not pretty. I felt that the Internal Affairs Officer had deemed me to be a troublemaker, saying that he knew that the big boss had engaged me on the matter even though I said that he did not. However, in truth, my discussion with the big boss on that matter in the entire nine months did not exceed ten lines. Okay, maybe twenty lines just to be generous. He told me that the big boss did a lot of things for me behind the scenes and asked if I know what had been done for me. I told him that I did not know what actions had been taken. This was my honest perspective as the management only communicated within themselves. Nothing was ever shared with me. No one informed if action was taken against my manager. No one engaged me to ask me more about the problem that I faced in my department. If they did engage anyone, I can only speculate that they talked to my manager. Weird isn‚Äôt it? When someone raise an issue, they do not try to learn more about the issue from the person raising the issue, but talk to the manager and ask her opinion on the person raising the issue. What kind of organization does not ensure the anonymity of the persons raising issues?  The internal affairs officer asked why I did not seek counseling or treatment after. I told him I was doing alright in the new department. I was also thinking: ‚Äòafter I left, I didn‚Äôt, because I would have to pay for my own counseling and I was not employed for a year already.‚Äô During this year, I fought hard against my dark thoughts using self-help cognitive therapy.  After a year of investigations, the internal affairs officer called me and said that they did not find my boss‚Äô behavior to be excessive. This was verbatim. I told him that some of the people I know had left SPF ‚Äì people whom I know were in the new department which the manager took over. He told me that people were leaving en masse from the public service not just SPF.  So, instead of trying to fix the problem, SPF buried it and condoned it? That is what I thought.  Given how negative the initial portions of the interview were by the internal affairs officer, I could only speculate how SPF processed my provided information when the minister forwarded the information to the feedback department of the police. I speculate that my division and my manager got hold of the information first, gathered information from people in my ex-department. If that was the case, how could the investigation and information gathered not be biased? The manager herself would be exerting pressure on those providing information. The same goes when the IAO officer was interviewing witnesses. Did the witnesses have to provide leave of absence with supervisors, and was there any pressure exerted onto them to be politically correct, given that the manager has rank and position?  And this concludes my story. I am trying to move on with life, trying to find positive interpretations of growth and peace to my dark thoughts and all the gaslighting. I considered suing SPF but it would take a toll on me financially, emotionally, and mentally.  I am writing this post because I believe people need to know what they are getting into when they sign that contract with SPF. They need to know that some parts of SPF are rotten and that one may experience a department and division that do not care about the mental wellbeing or the procedural justice that pertains to employee grievance. These structures may exist on paper, but are sorely lacking in reality. SPF would surely disagree given how well the persons involved can cover their asses.  I would like to end off by asking people who are looking to join SPF, not to believe my words at face value because this story is just my perspective, but to think critically for themselves, talk to friends who left SPF and see what their experiences are. Not just look at the rosy pictures painted by yearly advertisements. Be sure to give careful consideration to the monetary bond for those who sign on.  With all that is said, my conscience is clear. I have been blamed for not being resilient, not coping with my work, being unsuitable for being an IO, and having poor job fit, but I know better. I produced high quality work on complex cases that was recognized by my colleagues and manager at my new department, thanks to proper mentoring in the new department. I know better than to be gaslighted.  All that I have posted here are my personal perspectives. I am sure SPF would vehemently disagree given that the letter they sent me (portions attached below) had disavowed all legitimacy of my claims. After all, despite providing some evidence on chat, they have found ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô to substantiate my allegations.  Now, after two years of fighting my inner demons, I am taking a short course, with many thanks to skills future (kudos to the government on that) to pivot industry. I hope that everyone would be able to find workplaces that are not abusive and workplaces with functional employee grievance systems.  I am merely sharing my story because I believe people deserve to know. Be careful joining an organization that is so good at managing impressions. If they can with their conscience look at me and say that there are no problems, then so be it. The symptoms are all there. I fully empathize with the experiences of SGT Raja because I have experienced similar dysfunctional management where the big boss sides with the boss and there is no form of effective grievance handling in the force. There is no form of 3rd party investigation or whistleblowing within. You raise an issue against your colleague, your colleague will know. You raise an issue against your boss, your boss will know. They will then beat you down like they have done so towards me, like during the initial portions of the IAO investigation. Own self check own self. This is the consequences. If you are thinking that this story sounds ludicrous, I am thinking the same.  IAO officer got the guts to say to me on the phone that his investigations revealed that the manager‚Äôs treatment of me was not excessive and that SPF was losing a lot of people just like the other parts of public service, but got no courage to put it down on the reply he sent me. I can only conclude that the investigation was slipshod, biased towards the manager and never really finding out why I couldn‚Äôt cope. I can speculate that all sorts of problems are buried in this manner. I challenge SPF to send my investigation file and SGT Raja's for audit by a truly independent body, or even better, open those documents up for public scrutiny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/158ty2b/redditor_shares_experience_with_toxic_work/

I was caught off guard because the was connected immediately to a human and it didn’t have the usage record call options in weirdly accented English.The call was about 微信帳戶安全保險 or “WeChat account safety insurance.” Not sure about the official English translation. I googled a little and found that official WeChat stance on this is this is a free and non-chargeable service. First person who spoke to me was a man and spoke in Malaysian accented mandarin. The second person or “supervisor” was lady who spoke in Southern China accented mandarin. They will go back and forth talking to you about the whole 800sgd. The whole scam is about Unionpay is going to auto deduct 800sgd from your bank/card for this so-called insurance. The callers claims that you can opt-out and will begin guiding you. They will guide you to official WeChat Notice pay and tell you to tap “unresolved” followed by “this is unreasonable” and “this is not helpful.” Then they will ask you if there is red colour pop up which obviously doesn’t appear because this page is a self-help page the options they told you to tap is just a normal feedback page that appears in all self-help page. After they the “supervisor” will tell you they will get the WeChat team to help you cancel this so called “service” because your WeChat account has some problems because the red colour pop up didn’t appear. At this point I was 1080% sure this was a scam and hung up. They called back and I told they let Unionpay come and try deduct my money when I don’t have any transaction or business with Unionpay. I think I was lucky because I caught the scam before downloading any weird apps or giving up my bank or personal information.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1h7ue3h/scam_calls_posing_as_wechat_customer_service_rep/

t3_1cas2qd,"Do healthcare workers in healthcare, social service sectors get the option to WFH too? Possible suggestions?",reddit,Employment,2024-04-23 09:24:00,0.9834,"I wonder if healthcare workers will benefit from the recent WFH policy that has been announced? I am referring to healthcare workers, including medical professionals, allied health professionals. This can include doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, social workers, dietitians etc. across various sectors like restructured hospitals, community hospitals, social service agencies (rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, day care centres, special needs schools, early intervention centres). This list is non-exhaustive. According to the CNA article published on 17 April, “But if the flexible work arrangement negatively impacts the business, that would be an acceptable reason to reject the request”. Some hospitals and organisations are facing a lack of manpower. I will not elaborate on how or why this is happening, based on anecdotes, there are many factors, not limited to burn out, poor pay (that does not justify the workload), poor progression, lack of flexibility and more. With inflation and everything getting more expensive, this sometimes create additional stress and financial burden. Some organisations have always been lacking manpower due to high attrition rates; will this then become a reason for rejection? I understand that the roles of healthcare workers predominantly involve face-to-face physical interaction with patients/clients. However, I believe WFH arrangements can still be explored for healthcare workers to promote work-life balance, prevent burnout, which can possibly lead to better retention rates in the long run. Healthcare workers strive to be there to serve and help their patients/clients. Notwithstanding this, the WFH policy can be extended to healthcare workers. I understand that healthcare workers have to be accountable to their patients/clients. As such, I believe the following measures or points can be considered to still allow healthcare workers across various sectors to continue WFH:It is possible for healthcare professionals to perform their work remotely to a certain extent without being physically present. Doctors and some allied health professionals can provide services remotely by doing teleconsultations. There are telemedicine services in place, for example, teleconsultations provided by SingHealth polyclinics and NUHS, telemedicine mobile applications like Speedoc, WhiteCoat, ‘virtual’ wards at SGH where ""doctors, nurses, pharmacists and therapists care for patients with a combination of teleconsultations and home visits” (quote from SGH's website), some private physiotherapy clinics provide telehealth services too. It seems possible for medical professionals and allied health professionals to support patients remotely as well.Besides seeing patients/clients, I believe some professionals have a lot of administrative workload and preparation work to do before or after seeing their patients/clients. Are they then allowed to do it during WFH days? Some medical and allied health professionals have to constantly keep up with latest research publications to perform evidence based practices. With the workload during the day, some have to sacrifice their after work hours and weekends to catch up on this. Can such administrative tasks be done during WFH days?It would be a significant step to allow healthcare workers to adopt a hybrid work model. We definitely need healthcare workers to be physically present as well. Hence I was thinking a hybrid model may be feasible. For example, to allow employees to WFH for X out of 5 days in a week. If deemed that this will affect the provision of face-to-face services, I suggest having a roster, for example allowing employee A to WFH for X out of 5 days during the 1st and 3rd week of the month. Employee B does so on the 2nd and 4th week of the month. If there is a 5th week in the month, the employees may discuss, come to a consensus to take turns to WFH as needed. By having a roster between weeks, this may ensure that there is still a minimum number of healthcare workers on the ground to serve patients face-to-face. Even with the alternate week hybrid work model, it will still be a significant milestone for healthcare workers across various sectors. I believe this will improve work life balance, promote better mental well being. In the long run, this will help retain employees, minimise attrition, prevent the vicious cycle of employees leaving due to burnout, poor work life balance. I am interested to see how the ministry or relevant agencies can work on this to support this group of professionals. Please note that the above are my opinions and humble suggestions. Please feel free to add on, post questions and share your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cas2qd/do_healthcare_workers_in_healthcare_social/

t3_v5fxxc,Urgent help: Friends detained at JB because customs officers didn't stamp their passports,reddit,Legal,2022-06-05 15:40:00,0.9843,"Would really appreciate everyone's advice on what to do.For context, I went with a group of friends on a short 3D2N trip to JB. Most of our friend group went on Friday morning by bus, but 2 friends rented a car and joined later that evening. These 2 friends cleared the Woodlands checkpoint but ran into some issues with their Touch n Go card at the JB checkpoint (it was their first time travelling into Malaysia by car). The officer held onto their passports and directed them to sort it out at some kind of toll office, and when they finished up and came back, they didn't check whether their passports were stamped. While they obviously should have checked, I believe that this genuinely slipped their mind amidst the chaos and confusion.Earlier today we were returning to SG in the same rented car. The officers noticed that 2 passports lacked a stamp and took us for questioning. Imo, they were very hostile and intimidating -  for example one of them would walk over to a wooden board where they had printed out and pinned the relevant statute stipulating the maximum penalties etc, and made a big show of reading it. They also pulled one of us (who was a Malaysian aside) and kept communicating in Malay while not really explaining the situation to the rest of us, and repeatedly emphasized the gravity of the offence, the 14 day maximum detention period etc. They seemed very insistent on detaining my friends, even though my friends tried very hard to explain their case and even offered proof of entry via the causeway on their driver's app etc.So currently, my 2 friends are being detained there and are uncontactable. The rest of us headed back to SG via bus and have notified their family and friends. We've tried calling a few lines eg the High Commission but this all happened after office hours so we couldn't get a hold of most of them.I'm worried sick for my friends especially as I'm unfamiliar with the conditions of the detention center and how they're being treated. Would really appreciate advice/sharings by anyone who's encountered similar situations.&amp;#x200B;UPDATE: They are safely back in SG!

t3_1cgvns7,Why singapore produces no athletes?,reddit,Education,2024-04-30 23:28:00,0.9911,"Age old question, why is it that singapore cannot produce anyone to perform on the world stage? I think I actually might have the answer. It comes down entirely to having zero career opportunities and prize money in the early careers of sportsmans here.We could talk about all sorts of sports but the one that I want to specifically highlight is bowling. This is a sport that is essentially open to all ages, young or old, all the equipment is the same around the world and playing a 6 game 240 average isn't a inferior in any way. What I realize watching the PBA Jr Nationals is that even at 16/17 years old, these teens are able to earn enough money through competing that is roughly equivalent to a regular teen working full time at your usual part time jobs. And once they pass 18, they can compete in regionals that earn $25,000 as first place and with some of the youngest bowlers only at 20 bowling at PBA open championships with first place earning $100,000. Even at second or 3rd place, the prize money is basically equivalent to 1 year salary of your fresh grad poly. And I think that's the issue singapore has, which is that any kid here can compete and perform crazy good but there is literally no way to make even a part time living doing the sport past the age of 16/18. There is literally no way for some 18 year old to keep practicing hard at their sport that they have been playing since primary school. Because there is not even any money in it. I was bowling extremely competitively in secondary school, but after I graduated, I had nothing else to back me up, and I gave up the sport. And every time I see some 14,15 year old kid scoring well above 200, I always wonder, what's going to happen to them when they graduate? End up playing league?If we see places like the olympics is basically the high point of the career, what is the entry point? That is what singapore is desperately missing. Just think about it, as a uni student, if you spend 20 hours a week practicing your sport, you could essentially win enough money to last you your entire degree or even pay off your degree and it's a sport you've been doing all your life and you are clearly top of your game. And if you continue to practice, you can earn enough money to essentially play the sport full time.We don't even need that many competitions, we just need a handful enough a year that teens at the top of the level can continue to compete at after secondary school and make enough money like part time job. Because honestly when you try to compete on the level like commonwealth games 2024 is like asking a entry level worker to be on the same level as people with several years experience. So when we ask why aren't there any top level athletes in singapore, we have to ask, what's an 18 year old teen to do capitalise and earn money on his skill in a sport?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cgvns7/why_singapore_produces_no_athletes/

I'd recommend you to* [*read this website*](https://www.mytengah.sg/centralised-cooling/) *about the upcoming Tengah BTO estate project with a centralised cooling system to understand more. Central system does not mean everyone has to pay the same amount, or suffer under the same temperature. A centralised cooling system should (under ideal circumstances) not result in an extreme difference in home prices (the government should use taxpayers monies to research and build infrastructure for this). In fact, this system uses water cooling which is way more efficient than conventional aircon compressors (if we want to have any chance at seeing Singapore with &lt;40 degrees C temperature in the next 50 years due to the urban heat effect).*Looking at how unsustainable our climate issues have become, shouldn’t the government be investing more into infrastructure (edit: and/or research) for centralised cooling systems in all new BTOs?I know it’s not that simple and it involves costs (edit: and many other considerations as well).

The 3-piece OBU is also designed to operate reliably in an enclosed environment under the hot sun, unlike the 1-piece OBU that is designed to operate in an open environment. The 3-piece OBU also allows replacement to be done in parts (e.g. antenna only) rather than the replacement of all 3 pieces.    LTA conducted focus group discussions and surveys with motorists to gather feedback on the user experience and placement of the on-board unit (OBU). Based on the insights gathered, LTA further refined the OBU Graphical User Interface (GUI) and policies regarding its placement. LTA also collaborated with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to assess the safety of the on-board unit GUI by conducting driving simulation experiments with participants.""On one hand, it makes a bit of sense, modular can replace parts easily, more functions so bigger and bulkier, and they did consider safety through simulation with NTU. On the other hand, it is still bulky as hell, and placements in cars depend on the model, rip Porsche users.

The link address is broken up as I believe there are rules against providing direct links to social media. Link: bit dot ly slash appealtoNAFAImage: https://i.imgur.com/TAJcCh1.jpgTLDR: A strong turpentine smell came from my table on Thursday, 24 August 2023. Turpentine was poured on my belongings, artworks and materials. I am currently still recovering from symptoms such as rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my nose and eyes. This is my appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again for a thorough investigation, and for disciplinary actions to be taken towards those who were responsible for the act.Thanks for reading the following post. I am one who believes in spreading positivity on social media posts. Unfortunately, this is my final resort as I believe that more can be done to assist in the turpentine incident that I had raised. And I would like to hereby appeal to NAFA to look into the situation again and take disciplinary action towards those who were responsible for pouring turpentine onto my table, belongings, artworks and art materials on Thursday, 24 August 2023. On 24 August at 9.30am, I left some of my belongings, artworks and art materials on my studio desk. The studio is located at NAFA‚Äôs tower block. At 5.30pm, I came back to the studio and noticed a strong smell of turpentine coming from my table. The smell was also coming from my belongings, artworks and art materials. I went to the toilet immediately to get a tissue paper, soaked with soap and water and cleaned the table. My hands started to experience fiery sensations and I quickly packed my things. About half an hour after that, I experienced breathing issues and dizziness. My eyes and nose have also since experienced fiery sensations. Since the episode, I have repeatedly consulted doctors with regards to my symptoms and have not been able to attend school or complete my art assignments at all. In addition, I am not able to use any of my art materials since they have already been contaminated with turpentine. Currently, I am still recuperating from the symptoms of rashes, breathing issues, chest tightness, dizziness and fiery sensations in my eyes and nose. The incident had not only affected my physical health, but my mental health. I have been feeling angry, sad, anxious and confused all at the same time. What saddened me the most was that I had also shared some of my pre-existing medical conditions to the class, and yet, with the information provided, someone or a group of individuals had harmed my physical harm through the use of a hazardous chemical. I would like to highlight the following: 1. People who have pre-existing medical conditions deserve the right to study and work in a safe environment.2. Persons who have pre-existing medical conditions share their struggles in living with various conditions, not to be harmed.3. No one (regardless of whether they have or do not have pre-existing conditions) should never have their physical body harmed in any way.My heart just feels heavy at this moment and I‚Äôm crying while typing this. I would never wish for anyone to go through what I had gone through. And if anyone had gone through the same, I feel you and you are not alone. And please do the necessary by speaking up about what had happened and seek medical and professional help, if necessary. A school should be a safe place for students, whether physically or psychologically. However, in this situation, my physical health has been compromised. I hope NAFA will take actionable steps to investigate the situation, take disciplinary actions towards those who were responsible and their accomplices for the act.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/16j7xyd/harassment_using_turpentine_at_nafa/

In my view, there are 3 key reasons why our regulators should not approve the sale. 1.         First, between 2015 and 2020, NE increased its shareholding in NTUC Income from 30% to 70% by merely paying par value ($10 per share), when the true or market value of the shares was much higher. NE’s commitment not to redeem the shares was fundamental to NTUC Income allowing NE to obtain shares in NTUC Income at par value. This assurance helped NE increase its shareholding in NTUC Income from 30% to 70%, all at a mere par value of the shares.2.         Second, after NE got these substantial shares at par value and diluted minority shareholders, NTUC Income was corporatised but the assurance was given that NE would continue to be majority shareholder. 3.         Now, just less than 2 years later, NE is selling those shares to Allianz for a huge profit -  with Allianz becoming the majority shareholder. The sale to Allianz will fundamentally erode the social mission of NTUC Income. Allianz is a commercial enterprise focussed on pursuing profit. There is no reason to believe that Allianz will prioritise NTUC’s social mission above its own profits. As you can see, this is not merely about the sale of Income to Allianz, or only about the social mission of our cooperatives. At heart, it is about the integrity of commitments given by institutions on which we rely to safeguard our nation’s economic well-being and citizens’ interests. Surely, it is right to expect these commitments to be kept.  I have spoken up publicly about this issue given my background and familiarity with the issues. As loyal citizens who care for our country, we must  speak up on matters of public interest. This promotes accountability and a resilient society.It is in this spirit that I publish this open letter.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ei6oky

It has been designed primarily as a hub airport in mind and that's evident from the facilities, such as massive transit areas and security checks only at the gate (except T4) to prevent congestion.     That being said, it's also important that the airport serves Singapore and its hinterland well. To that effect, the current ground and sea transport options are still lacking:    - While there has been an MRT connection for more than two decades now, it's chronically underused. Through service to the EWL was abandoned shortly after opening, and in hindsight wasn't worth all the money and pretty architecture. It will be downgraded to a medium-capacity line once it's connected and converted to TEL. Crucially, unlike most other air hubs, there is no express rail service to the city. The only practical option, especially with heavy luggage and/or going outside of the east, is by car - which is not only prone to congestion but also runs counter to the car-lite philosophy.     - Bus service is also limited, crucially without either 1) express services or 2) overnight services. The buses that do service the airport are regular routes and only to a few destinations. There is/was a minibus shuttle service (not sure if it still exists) BUT it only serves certain hotels and runs on-demand, not scheduled. Passengers who land late or arrive early have no other choice but to travel via taxi/PHV. This is unlike nearly all other airports I have been. HKG, in contrast, offers excellent double-decker express services to not only downtown but various satellite new towns. **This issue would be easiest to solve: have 24-hour express services serving between the airport and various pick-up points/bus interchanges around the island.** - Sea transfers: I know there is a shuttle bus between the airport and Tanah Merah ferry terminal to serve Batam, but again, the T5 expansion offers an opportunity to emulate HKG's SkyPier - where passengers can head from/to nearby ports without going through immigration. Crucially, this can be expanded to support JB as well: not only does it heed the Johor state govt's call for more ferry links, this could also curtail the perennial issue of illegal airport transfers by Malaysian operators. I expect the rejoinder to be that the current options are good enough, since nobody else is complaining - if it ain't broke, don't fix it, need to consider livelihoods of taxi/PHV drivers etc.. But it's the soft side that does need some more improvement to further accentuate Changi's profile as a leading airport.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eyaxck/changi_airports_land_and_sea_transport_are_still/

Also, the earlier frustration of wanting to get a taxi but cannot get one, either on the street or via phone call. (Situation more than 10 years ago, so grab is a very useful service to humanities. )Overall, there is more good than bad. Also, the attitude of the grab driver is better as the app have a rating feature. I think we should just give them 5 stars if everything is ok, don’t need expect too much, as long as they are courteous and get us to the right location. I think taxi still have a place in Singapore. Earlier, I thought to support taxi, and book taxi using grab system, so that the taxi driver can drive relax, and I pay the meter fares accordingly, instead of fixed fare. When I feedback this to the taxi driver, they agrees too. However there is one incident, I notice that the fare entered is higher than the metered fare. It could be an oversight or something by the driver. The thing is if I did not take the picture of the fares. And the fares entered in is higher, I have no recourse. So everything is dependent on the taxi driver keying in of the fares.Taking a picture of the fares at the end of each trip gives the impression of not trusting the driver. The ideal situation is if there is a linkage between the metered fares and the app, but I believed this requires high level integration, and I don’t believe there will be the effort done, even though it will benefit everyone. I think grab also want to take care of their own PHV.Right now, I will alternate between justgrab(fixed fare) and GrabTaxi (meter fare)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1anw2v8/streethail_rides_dwindle_as_singapores_taxi/

t3_1cxciva,A small proof of concept to stop cigarette smoke from your neighbours,reddit,Public Health,2024-05-22 00:48:00,0.7789,"If you stay in an apartment and your neighbour smokes, some of that cigarette smoke may find its way into your house. This is not ideal. To fight this problem, I propose an automatic window closing system triggered by cigarette smoke. In particular, it is triggered by a spike in particulate matter concentration. This works because cigarette smoke is known to contain a large amount of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. (See: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352107/#:\~:text=They%20found%20that%20the%20most,µm%20sized%20particles%20%5B57%5D.)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352107/#:~:text=They%20found%20that%20the%20most,µm%20sized%20particles%20%5B57%5D.))# Demonstrationhttps://reddit.com/link/1cxciva/video/vdscdqdr6t1d1/player*You can see the Arduino, sensor, and motor driver hanging haphazardly on the left side of the video.*# Does it really work?Yes somewhat. Currently, if you smell cigarette smoke in your apartment, it would be too late to close your windows. If you close your windows, the cigarette smoke would be trapped in the house with you. If you don't, the cigarette smoke gets stronger and stronger. With this new set-up, the window completely closes within 30-45 seconds of the start of the event. This protects your apartment from the bulk of the wave that follows.https://preview.redd.it/2eth9bws6t1d1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ab7175f461a1704ae7fc8045586fbe8b4d483aThe 30-45 seconds is not a hard limit. It's due to:* Poor sensor placement due to the a limit on how long the data cables could be* Insufficiently sensitive algorithm to differentiate between noise and an actual smoke event* Unoptimal speed of actuator (running at 60-70% of maximum currently) to close the windows due to an inefficient motor driver. With the entire setup optimised, the response time should be as short as 12-15 seconds (from start of event to complete window closure). Nonetheless, at the moment, the proof of concept demonstrates that it should work.The rest of this post would be dedicated to a technical description.# High Level ideahttps://preview.redd.it/hnlos2cu6t1d1.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd1e14cfbf5575d9d5dd2aeb433018dee83f3f911. The particulate sensor continuously monitors particulate concentrations and feeds it to a microcontroller.2. The microcontroller receives the data and uses an algorithm to determine when there is a spike. When a spike is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to the motor driver.3. The motor driver selects the speed and the direction of the motor in the actuator.4. The actuator closes the window.# Low level implementationAn overview of the physical setup is as follows: https://preview.redd.it/kj5e6k1w6t1d1.png?width=2184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b084d8efad34b799d569229f0a39bc4513e670c# Particulate SensorThe particulate sensor is an Adafruit PMSA0003I sensor, mounted on an Adafruit breakout board, that detects particulate matter using an in-built laser. The particles are measured according to binned particulate sizes. For our case, we considered the smallest bin (0.3-1.0μm) because we observed the biggest spike in this interval. The sensor was programmed to take readings every 3 seconds. This is acceptable because the single-response time for the sensor is ≤1 second and it is not too unreasonably slow to detect spikes in readings. These readings were then sent to an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 Microcontroller.We remark that the particulate sensor requires 5V to be powered. For power and data communications, we connected the breakout board to an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 via a Stemma QT cable (see: https://www.mouser.sg/ProductDetail/Adafruit/4209?qs=PzGy0jfpSMvCXPIwCvMoFg%3D%3D). The connection details are detailed here https://learn.adafruit.com/pmsa003i/arduino.# MicrocontrollerThe Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 microcontroller receives sensor data and translates that to signal data. If we take a look at the incoming data, it is extremely noisy. To smooth out the noise, we applied a Kalman filter. See [https://www.cs.unc.edu/\~welch/media/pdf/kalman\_intro.pdf](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf) for more details. Within a short interval, we expect the sensor data to be roughly constant. The Kalman filter was designed under this assumption. Upon applying the Kalman filter, we shall take it as the 'ground truth'.When we observed the data over time, we observe sharp spikes. These spikes correspond to two different pollution sources: incense and cigarette smoke. Incense burns slowly over time so the spike lasts for a few hours. On the other hand, cigarette smoke is characterised by a sharp spike of about 10-15 minutes in duration.Regardless of the source, we want to close the window whenever a spike is detected. To do this, a lagging baseline is taken. We define the baseline at a point in time as the median value of the 'ground truth' values in a five minute window. This corresponds to data that is 5-10 minutes old. If at any moment the positive difference between the 'ground truth' and the baseline is larger than the 98.5th percentile of the distribution, we trigger the actuator. The trigger works by sending a LOW/HIGH signal to the Motor Driver.Why 98.5th percentile? It just seems to work. Choosing a smaller percentile like 97th percentile leads to more false positive window closures (maybe not a bad thing) whereas choosing a larger percentile leads to much slower response times.# Actuator and Motor DriverThe inexpensive L298N bridge serves as a motor driver. The bridge helps us to control the speed (but it is not important here since we just want it go to at maximum speed) and the direction. The direction is controlled by a LOW/HIGH signal from the Arduino. To swap the direction, we simply flip the signals and send a HIGH/LOW signal instead.The Hakiwo 12V Linear Actuator was purchased off Aliexpress and has a power rating of 20W and a rated speed speed of 100mm/s. This sounds pretty good on paper as the sliding window would close in 7 seconds. However, in practice, the speed when:1. directly connecting the actuator to a 12V DC Power Supply is about ±85-90mm/s.2. connected to a 12V DC Power Supply via the L298N bridge is about ±58mm/s. The significant difference in speed could be attributed to the voltage drop incurred by the L298N bridge. It was stated that when 12V is supplied to L298N bridge, only 10V actually reaches the motor. Hence, the massive heatsink to dissipate the heat. See https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/.# LoggingWe want to log the data and be able to have convenient access to the data. To do so, we connected the Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 to AWS IoT Core service. Subsequently, we routed messages sent from AWS IoT Core to AWS Timestream which is basically a database. To visualise the data, we sent it to AWS-managed Grafana.See [https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/opta/getting-started-with-aws-iot-core/](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/opta/getting-started-with-aws-iot-core/) on how to set it up.# Algorithm DesignAfter logging the data into AWS Timestream, we would like to load the data on my personal computer to design the algorithm. We unloaded it to AWS S3 and downloaded the archive file. We used Julia on an .ipynb instance. *Julia because it's faster than Python.* Upon designing and verifying the algorithm on past data, it is then translated into C++ for uploading to the Arduino.Algorithm Subplots Check The plot generated above is used for us to visually inspect the effectiveness of the algorithm. Visually, the spikes are all *protected* (actuators are activated throughout the duration of a cigarette smoke event). Although it's not that effective with the incense pollution but that's not a problem for us at the moment.# To take note* The Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 Wifi chip is really weak. My empirical observations was if the Wifi signal is less than -60dBm, you would not be able to reliably connect to your router.* When the Ardunio is powered by a USB connection and the Adafruit PMSA0003I particulate sensor is powered from the Arduino, there would not be enough power to boot both the Arduino and the sensor when first connected to the power supply. To fix this, the 5V wire of the stemma qt cable is disconnected when the Arduino is powered. Once the CHRG light on the Arduino has stopped blinking, we reconnect the wire.* If the Arduino and sensor are powered separately, it does not work either. I don't know why.# Total Cost* SGD65 - Sensor (Mouser)* SGD50 - Arduino (Mouser)* SGD70 - Actuator (Aliexpress)* SGD2 - L298N bridge (Shopee)* SGD10 - Mounting tapes (Hardware shops)* SGD1/mth - AWS# Future improvements1. Lower Cost - The current cost is about SGD200. However it can be reduced further by switching to ESP32s. If there is sufficient demand for mass production, unit prices for the electronics would be 5-20% lower and custom PCBs would allow us to avoid the premium associated with breakout boards.2. Better Motor Driver - The current L298N bridge is too inefficient and too bulky. It retards the actuator too much. Additionally, if the actuator were to upgraded to a higher speed actuator which requires 5A of current, the L298N would be unsuitable.3. Better spike trigger algorithm - The current algorithm still takes about 10-30 seconds from start of smoking to full window closure. If the algorithm is too sensitive, then it is prone to triggering sometimes by noise. If the algorithm is too insensitive, then too much cigarette smoke would enter the apartment before getting triggered.4. Cheaper microcontroller - The Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 microcontroller is fairly expensive at about 39 USD. Since ESP32s are inexpensive and they have an efficient protocol (ESP-NOW) for communication between ESP32s, we can assign each device a microcontroller -- one for the sensor, one for each actuator, and one for control. We would no longer be limited by the length of the data cables. We would then be able to have more optimal placement of the sensors and the actuators.5. Faster actuator - If we need to get more mileage out of this entire setup, a faster actuator that goes at 150mm/s can be considered.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cxciva/a_small_proof_of_concept_to_stop_cigarette_smoke/

Been refusing to acknowledge that I am suffering from depression and gritting my teeth and thought I need to just man up but I think that is no longer possible. Family relationships suffered due to my mood swings and constant anger and lousy moods. I also resigned from my full time job last year as I couldn't handle the stress of working long hours every other day and it became very very very difficult to wake up every day and to get to work. Wife saw symptoms which I denied and gave ultimatum is either get help or we separate as she cannot handle my anger, pessimism, and constant nagging and borderline verbal abuse on occasions.I am seeking subsidised assistance because wife is shouldering 80% of the financial responsibilities at home with the expenses for the two young children while I pay for utilities and various groceries expenses. I am relying on my savings accumulated over the years and doing some part time work at the moment to get some pocket money. I am also currently aggressively applying for full time work but since beggining of Jan 2023, there has not been any calls for interviews.Can any kind souls on reddit share their experience if any via IMH and what is the route they took to get subsidised mental health assistance.Thank you all in advance.Edit: thank you all for sharing your experiences and also the many information. Will need a bit of time to sift through and explore the best options. As this matter I raised is really foreign to me and I never thought I would be having to get help...Update: got a referral from polyclinic and the appointment with IMH is in June.

However, 162M only duplicates the TEL from Bright Hill to Orchard, before heading towards Suntec and looping at Esplanade. Due to the stark difference in routing, it doesn't make sense for it to fall under LTA's TEL route rationalisation. The service serves as a direct link from town to many housing estates eg. Sin Ming, Bishan and AMK, and also runs way past the last NSL and TEL train departures from town. (The last bus leaves Suntec at 1230am, which is 45 mins after the last NSL train departs City Hall).&#x200B;I've been taking the service home after going out in town as it gives me the choice to sit down and avoid the crowded post-dinner northbound NSL trains. It takes approx 50 mins to get from Suntec to Bishan Park, and it would roughly take the same time if i were to take NSL to Bishan, walk to the bus stop and change to another bus to take me home. At most, I'd save 10 minutes on a good day, but I would gladly trade that 10 mins for greater comfort and a break from walking about town.&#x200B;By truncating 162M, the authorities are missing the forest for the trees. It's all about trying to achieve higher KPIs, lowering costs, and better transport times on paper, but it doesn't benefit real residents in any way. &#x200B;This time it was my estate. It could be your neighbourhood next. Even if you're not a resident in these estates, we have to let the authorities know what we think of their unilateral decisions.

Why aren't there laws requiring employers to do so? Increasing salary with inflation isn't even giving employees a raise in their real wages - their wages stay stagnant.Isn't that the least employers should do?Edit:Thank you all for educating me! I see now that this might not be a feasible and sustainable solution. I wrote this post with the intent to advocate for fair compensation for workers but this might be an oversimplifed solution that might not work.Regardless, the original intent is still there. I hope that if you have an idea of the direction society needs to take to balance out the power dynamic between employer and employee, you would comment below so everyone can learn from your knowledge.

t3_1c0c69q,Designated smoking points to address the issue of secondhand smoke,reddit,Public Health,2024-04-10 11:47:00,0.9673,"**Concerned Citizen's Appeal:**You spent a lot of money on a BTO, designing and renovating it. You envision yourself spending a long time with your loved one, raising young kids, working and growing old in this place.Then it turns out that a neighbour smokes. The smoke wafts into your house, forcing you to close the windows. Fine; just a minor annoyance, right? But as days go by, you start to stress out with uncertainty. When will the smoke come today? Should I keep my windows closed permanently? But I saved up so much for it, why do I need to sacrifice my enjoyment/ventilation because of another person’s life choices?And let's not forget the impact on our children. We've invested so much in their well-being, sacrificing our own careers and comfort to provide them with the best possible start in life. Yet, here they are, exposed to yet another health hazard that they don't deserve.We've tried diplomacy, reaching out to our neighbors in the hopes of finding a solution. But too often, our pleas fall on deaf ears or are met with indifference. And the government, while acknowledging the problem, offers little more than platitudes and excuses. It's disheartening, to say the least.Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) have been proposed as a potential solution, providing smokers with a designated space to indulge while protecting the health and well-being of non-smokers. However, little information has come out of that initiative thus far. Yes, there would be costs involved in setting up and maintaining these areas, but when weighed against the toll of inaction, they seem like a small price to pay.So here's my call to action: let's push for renewed piloting and experimentation of DSPs in HDB blocks. It's time to move beyond the gridlock of inaction and take concrete steps towards finding a solution that works for everyone. And if we can gather enough support, I'm more than willing to take our cause to our representatives, to ensure that our voices are heard.Together, we can make a difference. Leave an upvote, share your thoughts, and let's start a conversation about how we can protect our homes and our health for generations to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1c0c69q/designated_smoking_points_to_address_the_issue_of/

What happened to Mr Chua Meng Kah?",reddit,Public Safety,2024-08-16 18:41:00,-0.9962,"Bringing another write up over this week, took some time to tidy this one up, but hope it's just as good as the previous ones**A Background of Mr Chua**58 year old Mr Chua Meng Kah was a taxi driver for 26 years, working with his elder son Alan. Alan would drive the day shift, while Mr Chua would take over for the night shift. Mr Chua was described by his loved ones as a family man, and was not known to have any drinking/gambling habits, nor did he have any debts with unlicensed moneylenders or ties to illegal activities.On 30 January 1987. despite it being the Chinese New Year period, Mr Chua left the house for his usual night shift. That would be the last time anybody saw Mr Chua alive.**Finding the Taxi**Mr Chua's taxi was first reportedly seen around 2am on 31 January 1987, when a police patrol spotted it at parked at Orchard Boulevard with its headlights on and engine running. However, the alarm was not raised as the officers simply believed that the driver was simply catching a mid-shift rest in his taxiAt 7:25am, when the officers returned to the same spot, they were puzzled to see that the taxi still parked at the same spot, exactly the same way as it was when they last saw it. This prompted the officers to conduct a check, fearing that something had happened to its driver. However, when the officers checked the taxi, there was no sign of anyone & the taxi's meter was still running. Alarmingly, a pair of handcuffs, a blood-stained scraper & a gun holster was found in the taxi.The alarm was raised, and upon further analysis of the taxi, a caliber round was found lodged in the coin compartments. Police now expressed concern that Mr Chua's life was in danger, and speculation soon arose that he may have met the same fate as 2 other taxi drivers.**A String of Crimes - Coincidence or Careful Planning?**The first case was that of Mr Lai Wah Joon, which occurred on 17 December 1986. His taxi was found burning at Jalan Loyang Besar and an assortment of things from the taxi was found scattered, however his body was only found later in an advanced state of decomposition with several stab wounds 2km from the taxi. No arrests were made for this case.The second case happened 2 weeks after Mr Chua's disappearance, 17 February 1987 when another taxi driver picked up 4 passengers at Changi and was directed to drive to a variety of destinations. At the last stop (described as a temple at Jalan Loyang Besar), he was threatened by one of the passengers in the backseat. However, unlike Mr Lai's case, he was subsequently blindfolded & tied to a tree, while the passengers drove away in his taxi. He managed to free himself and reported the robbery to the police.An alert was sent to all ground police patrol units to look out for the stolen taxi, which was eventually spotted by a police patrol along a lane in Tanjong Katong Road with 3 of the 4 passengers rounded up along with it. When questioned, they confessed that they had hijacked the taxi in order to use it as a getaway vehicle for a planned robbery of a goldsmith's store.With similar targets & MOs, police believed that the 3 cases were perpetrated by the same group of attackers, however police could not find any evidence linking Mr Chua's disappearance or Mr Lai's death to the attackers the police had nabbed. As far as the evidence showed, it seemed that they were conducted by separate groups/individuals.**The Search Goes Cold**While both police and personal investigations yielded no clue to Mr Chua's whereabouts or his fate, the general consensus was that Mr Chua had encountered an armed robber during his night shift. However, the family maintained that Mr Chua was unlikely to have been the specific target of the assailant, given that he was not owing any money nor did he have any criminal/underground connections. Yet, the presence of a firearm seemed to indicate that he was not just the victim of an opportunistic crime, but a hardened criminal.With no suspects or body to close the case, the case remains open and unsolved, and as time went by the family tried to move on. Alan continued to drive the taxi, now taking the night shifts that Mr Chua used to take.As of 2004, Mr Chua Meng Kah was declared dead in absentia, 18 years after he went missing.**Questions*** What do you think happened to Mr Chua? Could it have been an opportunistic attack or something larger?* Could the group of attackers nabbed by the police have indeed been the perpetrators for all 3 incidents?**Sources:**[Taxi-driver missing](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870328-1.2.56), [Mystery finds in missing cabby's vehicle](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870204-1.2.20.4) , [Bullet found in missing cabby's taxi](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870206-1.2.23.12) - Archived news articles detailing Mr Chua's disappearance[Taxi found burnt and cabby missing](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861222-1.2.9), [Missing cabby: Police seek dental records](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861227-1.2.23.7), [Decomposed body is missing cabby's, say pathologists](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870217-1.2.23.16) - Archived news articles detailing Mr Lai's case, as well as the subsequent identification[Suspects held — one minute after taxi was reported lost](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870218-1.2.3) - Archived news article detailing the robbery & subsequent arrest of the 3rd incident.[Missing - The Missing Taxi Driver](https://www.mewatch.sg/watch/Missing-S2-E7-The-Missing-Taxi-Driver-57085) - (DISCLAIMER - I do not advise watching at night)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1etlh8m/an_abandoned_taxi_a_spate_of_similar_crimes_but/

Pretty much the same how it was experienced. I had 3 relatively large plastic bags kinda like ikea sized bags but slightly smaller. They were filled with new clothes and bags. Plastic bags were new and clean. Gojek Driver in Honda Vezel (SUV) arrived. Stepped out to help load one of the bags and then promptly changed his mind and told me he cannot take me because I need to book a 6-seater. Mind you, I‚Äôm the only passenger. There‚Äôs plenty of space inside and at the back. Even if there isn‚Äôt, my items can be squeezed to fit. The driver also mentioned that I need to book a 6-seater if I‚Äôm carrying many items with me. I told him that was nonsense especially when my items are not bulky. Never had issues when I had bulky items from with me. He drove away and canceled my ride after 5 mins. I was charged $4 by GoJek for him cancelling on me. I ended up booking a cab that came in a prius. My 3 bags fits just fine with some space available for the cab driver‚Äôs items. So what, are we not allowed to carry anything heavy when we book a 4-seater grab or gojek now?Did something change that triggered such behaviour among PHV drivers? Or am I just unlucky to such a driver? Perhaps the latter.*EDIT 1*: My $4 got refunded within the same day of incident. Gojek also gave me a call. Assured me that driver received demerits for this issue and they will be contacting the driver on the matter. Also confirmed that driver cancelled on me instead of a ‚Äúno-show‚Äù.

It was first announced as the North South Expressway on 30 January 2008. This year, 2023, was when it was expected to be completed. NSC is expected to bring some benefits to Singaporeans, such as reduced travel times and improved connectivity, it also has had a number of negative impacts. Let's look at the issues observed thus far.&#x200B;**Delay in Construction Timeline**NSC was initially planned with an expected completion date of 2023. Then 2024, 2026 and 2027. The latest news is that it will be fully completed only in 2029, 6 years later than previously announced. The delay is partially due to Covid-19 disruptions - but covid disruptions isn't even half as long as the delay. Other challenges include challenging terrain conditions and land acquisitions.&#x200B;**Localized** **Pollution**Residents near the NSC have been affected by noise and air pollution, and some residents even reported trembles in their blocks. Construction activities often run late into the night. Although LTA said that it avoids noisier construction activities at night, mainstream news have reported otherwise. Air pollution from construction activities are often underreported due to the fact that no government agency actively monitors the surrounding air quality at construction sites.&#x200B;**Travel Inconvenience**Travel from North to South and you will see the countless road diversions and bus stop re-locations. For road users, the diversion of traffic have led to confusion, longer travel times and congestions. For public transport users, it means travelling to a further temporary bus stop, often without original supporting infrastructure such as shelters and proper walkways. As somebody who can only afford public transport, this frustrates me the most. Walking is tough, and cycling on pedestrian paths is next to impossible due to conditions of the makeshift roads. LTA has also shifted 4 bus stops in the vicinity (and all of them further than before) and they won't bother building sheltered walkways for the ""temporary"" bus stops for the next 6 years.&#x200B;**Health Impact**Higher levels of air and noise pollutions arise from the increased traffic and increased construction activity. This cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and negatively impacts sleep quality and mental health.&#x200B;I'm aware of other issues concerning the environment and businesses but I would leave them up to you guys to share. We all know that NSC is a major infrastructure project that is likely to have a significant impact on Singapore roads in the future. However, I thought that it is important to be aware of both the benefits and negative impacts of the project, especially since the delay means that current stakeholders will have to endure these issues for a longer period. In my opinion, the government can take further steps to mitigate the negative impacts of the project.

But my annoyance soon turns to mirth as I realise he is missing a shoe.The young man turns towards the doors, his face once again filling up with anxious urgency as he realises that one of his shoes, an aptly-named slipper, had slipped off his foot and landed on the other side of the now-closed doors due to his haste.

This man - otherwise dressed decently in a plain shirt and cargo shorts - is now left standing among his fellow train passengers with but one shoe.He has won the battle of the doors.

The scary part is that this is his 3rd encounter with the person, with these encounters spanning a period of 2 years. This post will detail what happened yesterday, followed by the description of the weird man.Yesterday's encounter:The weird man approached my friend while he was with his girlfriend and aggressively went up to his face (literally inches away) saying that he looks very familiar, asking if he was from the same secondary school as him while touching his arm. My friend said no and gestured for him to leave but as they were leaving the location, they could hear the man following them. They then picked up their pace — and that was when the man did the same, blocking their path; and again, touched his arm and said that my friend looks familiar, asking the same question of whether or not they were from the same secondary school.My friend's gf then shouted at him to leave and he backed off for awhile, but he was still loitering around them for a few minutes, after which he approached a few different people, initiating non-consensual physical contact (touching and holding shoulders/back etc.)Apparently my friend's friend encountered him before too and they found out that his method of approach is always the same, asking if a guy is from a certain secondary school, then telling him he looks familiar. He also seems to approach guys with a fit figure.Visual description of the individual:Age - Mid to late 30sHeight - 1.65m to 1.70mBuild - SkinnyHair - Short and messy, black with white strandsAttire - Black shirt, cargo pants, shoes/slippersMy friend has since lodged a police report but was just wondering if anyone here knows who this person is because he was abit shook from the experience.

t3_xyu006,The astronomical increase in 3 room resale prices in the 4 cheapest non-mature estates from '19 to '22 vs wage growth for youths and seniors from '19 to '21,reddit,Housing,2022-10-08 14:21:00,0.9929,"We are concerned with small resale flats because they provide immediate housing to young couples, especially crucial for those planning on having children, and for singles 35 and over. They serve as a benchmark on how affordable it is to get married/have children.**Key takeaway**For the cheapest non-mature estates of Woodlands, Bukit Batok, Jurong West, and Yishun, prices rose from $240,000, $258,000, $260,000, and $260,000 in Q2 2019 to $337,000, $345,000, $340,000, and $360,000 in Q2 2022. That's an increase of 40.1%, 33.7%, 30.7%, and 38.4%! (I picked 4 instead of 3 because the 3rd place was tied in 2019.)Edit: a dual citizen couple earning $5,000 and not staying near parents would get $95,000 in grants. After 95k in grants, a three room flat at the median price in Jurong West and Woodlands, which had the smallest and largest increase in prices, would be $163,000 and $145,000, and $250,000 and $242,000 in 2019 and 2022 respectively. This is a **53.4% and 66.9%** increase respectively, which also applies for your monthly loan repayments! The repayments for a maximum 25 year HDB loan went from $592 and $526 for Jurong West and Woodlands to $907 and $878! That's more than the cost of infant care after subsidies ($264)! While this is still below the 30% of monthly pay threshold, shouldn't we be alarmed by the dramatic increase? **Wage growth in youth?**However, the wage growth from June 2019 to June 2021 for youth below 35 (excluding NSFs, full-time employed only, including CPF) was negative to negligible, which is a very different image from the overall median wage growth. Those from 55-59 had significantly higher wage growth. Therefore housing has been even more unaffordable for young couples than those who have been just become able to start withdrawing from CPF. And now, the prices of the most affordable small resale flats will likely rise even further than 5 room and larger because of the loophole for those who are above 55 being allowed buy a resale immediately without having to rent/move in with relatives for 15 months in the new restrictions on private to non-subsidised resale downgraders.From ages 20-24, 25-30, and 30-34, the median wage was respectively $2,730, $4,081 and $5,197 in 2019, and $2,691, $4,095, $5,222 in 2021. This was a change of -1.42%, 0.34%, and 0.48%.This contrasts with the 2.56% increase in overall median monthly income from $4,563 to S$4,680 over the same period.**Wage growth in seniors and consequences for the loophole**What about those able to take advantage of the loophole in the new regulations? Those aged 55-59 had their wages grow from $3,563 to $3,729, or 4.66%. That's 82.0% higher than the overall median monthly income growth.Those over 60 had their wages fall from $2,562 to $2,543, or -0.74%. That's around half the percentage loss than those from 20-24. Therefore, since those from 55-59 had wage growth nearly double of wage growth across all ages, shouldn't the loophole be at least limited to those over 60? **Conclusion and disclaimer**The resale prices for 3 room flats in non-mature estates have grown by much more since before the pandemic compared to wages across the youngest and oldest age groups, which have remained flat or even fallen.While the calculations for the increase in resale prices at the start of the post included an additional year of increase compared to the wage growth data, the extent of total increase deserves to be calculated. And I'm too tired from typing this from my phone already to take the 2021 Q2 resale data and compare the increase between both 2019 and 2022.Edit: only a few estates are offered BTO every quarter and the attractiveness of the developments vary. New flats made available after MOP would significantly change prices that quarter and afterwards. I could have used an average of Q1 and Q2 prices to smooth that out, which is more important than matching the Q2 prices with the June wage levels.Compound annual growth rate might have been a better option instead of a simple percentage growth over the initial value, I'm not sure. For the least and most appreciating estates, Jurong West and Woodlands, the CAGR is 9.35% and 11.98%.Please double check my math and quote me without my username!**Links**Q2 2019 resale prices (Annex C):https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/release-of-2nd-quarter-2019-public-housing-dataQ2 2021:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/23072021-Release-of-2nd-Quarter-2021-Public-Housing-DataQ2 2022:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/22072022-Release-of-2ndQuarter-2022-Public-Housing-Data2019: MEDIAN  GROSS  MONTHLY  INCOME  FROM  WORK  ( INCLUDING  EMPLOYER  CPF )  OF  FULL-TIME  EMPLOYED  RESIDENTS  AGED  FIFTEEN  YEARS   AND  OVER  BY  HIGHEST  QUALIFICATION  ATTAINED,  AGE  AND  SEX,  JUNE  2019 (Table 23 Page 116)https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2021.aspx2021: (Table 24 page 128)https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2021.aspx(2020 figures were omitted because of the impact of the Circuit Breaker on statistics)The maximum HDB loan is 80% of the home value (down from 85% with the new cooling measures), 20% downpayment payable with grants and Ordinary Account.

t3_14pnnmb,"Going overseas to seek inpatient mental health treatment? (working,studying,holiday,medical tourism?)",reddit,Healthcare,2023-07-03 16:24:00,0.9847,"Actually this topic has been on my mind for quite some time. It's because I have harboured thoughts of working/studying overseas - but one point that my pdoc has brought up is always the lack of social support/how I can rely on my parents in SG(which I find is utter rubbish as my parents don't provide much emotional support and getting hospitalised in IMH in a crisis really sucks)But can this be mitigated with good insurance? I remember that I wanted to go overseas for my final sem at my private uni, and they told me about comprehensive health coverage, including medical repatriation in case of emergency.Yes, in the USA/UK, they have funding cuts, people thrown into prison instead of mental hospitals, too few mental hospitals for people, long waiting times and yada yada. But you have multiple hospitals for mental health, and it's not centralised like IMH and some other wards in general restructured hospitals - so you can probably choose a hospital instead of being warded in IMH c-class wards against your will.I mean IMH is pretty shit for inpatient hospitalisation, and I know peers with BPD who were kicked out from the more conducive Mood Disorders Unit(MDU). Plus, each person may spend 1 month in MDU, making it hard for other people to use the facilities.Also in Australia, you have short-term crisis centres where you can rest there and recuperate instead of going to a hospital.I digress, looking at Britney Spears, I believe due to her A-list status and her being rich, she would never be thrown into one of those third-rate psychiatric hospitals in the USA. Probably UCLA or somewhere conducive for recovery. I guess it's the same for rich people anywhere in the world. They can probably check themselves into Mount E, but if you get sent into IMH, good luck.Digressing further from this topic,some people with chronic mental health illnesses have benefitted from a month's sabbatical overseas, ie. homestays or backpacking trips.So I would like to hear your thoughts, whether you are a healthcare professional, or a person seeking mental health treatment on how feasible/unfeasible is it to seek mental health treatment overseas esp when you are working/studying overseas. Or perhaps medical tourism etc? Or if you are there on a holiday and happened to relapse?This is probably quite a touchy topic. I mean, some may argue that at least having beds in IMH helps to ensure that lives are saved, instead of people becoming homeless/people committing suicide/going to jail aka USA. But then again, some may argue about the right-to-live/right-to-die and how people overseas have more freedom of choice.For me, based on my personal experience, my stays in the C-class wards have been so traumatising that I would prefer not to be saved. I have had recurring dreams in the past where I was hallucinating/going out of control and the ambulance sent me to IMH. Some dreams were super peculiar, ie. sitting on a yoga mat in a dance hall, ie. strapped to a stretcher and staring out of the window with nothing to do. The theme is always about having nothing to do.I know there's the Short Stay Unit and they are trying to improve their services and all, but I am not sure if they have the budget/infrastructure to really revamp majority of the wards? You can argue about why there's no specialised ward for personality disorders also since they would benefit the most from therapy and less of medicine - more and more people are getting diagnosed with BPD every year and the incidence is catching up with depression. (Maybe some commentators might try to armchair diagnose me based on this statement) Or you can argue that only a small majority of people benefit from MDU/EPIP so far.TL;DR; Going overseas to seek mental health treatment(inpatient) as a skilled worker, as a student or as a tourist with a relapse or even maybe medical tourism - is it feasible? What are the barriers?Ps. I stayed in Sayang wellness before and NUH. Would rather be in a c class ward/b2 ward with decent facilities to save money. People stayed in Sayang for one month ended up spending 10k. I was only there for 7 days, thank God. and Sayang only for stable patients, heard Mount E is even more ex than Sayang but ok with suicidal pts. I also visited people on mdu before. Tbh I rather be warded for a physical condition in c class ward than imh acute c class ward. At least I can use the phone n I won't be shuffled back and forth. And maybe they will give me opiates or painkillers to make me drowsy instead of being alert and restless af. I have stayed in the holding area in general hospitals due to medical complications for suicide attempt and I prefer that experience prior to ambulance transfer. The ambulance transfer really fucks with you. You think u are going somewhere nice but reality hits. So when ppl talk about going c class for physical illness if no insurance rider etc, I call bullshit on this one. No air con won't die, but IMH c class ward really fucks with you. I wrote in to assoc prof Chua when he was CEO of IMH to complain, but once you go in, you are at their mercy.It's crazy how therapeutic having my Paimon doll, other dolls,stuffed toys and Netflix/games is.

t3_13np2sd,"Opinion: The elderly, pregnant and disabled have more entitlement to use ""Priority seats"" than the rest of commuters. Commuters outside these demographics who use these seats do not have the right to doze off/tune out by using earphones.",reddit,Transport,2023-05-21 10:08:00,-0.4985,"I commute to and from work every day, with a 1 hour journey each way, so I have plenty of experience observing MRT habits and behaviours. For reference, I am in my 20s, so I am young and (relatively) healthy. I have noticed that it is not uncommon to see young people using priority seats, and often listing to music with their earphones in, or falling asleep.In my humble opinion, people outside the 'priority' demographics do not have the right to get too comfortable in these seats, lest they deprive someone more deserving of the seat of the seat. When you sit in a priority seat, you should always be ready to give it up to someone who needs it more.One reasoning many young people, in my generation, use to justifying sitting in one is ""we should remove priority seats, because it gives the elderly/pregnant/disabled a false sense of entitlement"". The purpose of reserved seats is that it places the primary onus upon people sat in those seats to give up their seats to those who need it more. If all reserved seats are filled with people from the 'priority' demographics, the onus would then shift to people seated in other seats. If there were no 'priority' seats, everyone would wait for someone else to give up the seat, which would not work.More often than not, the priority seats tend to be vacant, while other seats are occupied. I, for one, will usually wait for a non-priority seat to be available before I sit down. When I am seated in other, non-priority seats, I expect that young people seated in priority seats should give up their seats, as those seats are the ones that are, first and foremost, earmarked for those who need it. If they do not give up their seats when there is someone who needs it more in front of them, I would tend to give them disapproving glances until they conform to this social expectation. On the rare occasion that I sit down in a priority seat, I do so with the understanding that if someone who needs it more enters the train car I am in, I should make reasonable effort to give up the seat for them.Many of my peers argue, ""its not compulsory"" or ""I paid the same fare as the elderly"". In a similar vein, it is not compulsory to hold the door open for someone who is right behind you when you walk through it. However, if you choose not to do so, you are demonstrating exceptionally poor manners, and it is more than reasonable that you should expect to be chided for your poor manners. Similarly, if you choose to occupy a 'priority seat' and fall asleep/tune out, other commuters have every right to chide you on your lack of manners.TLDR: Priority seats are for those who need it, if you sit in one (and are not from the demographic who needs it), be prepared to give it up at a moments notice.EDIT: This is not a popular opinion and I'm prepared for the downvotes lol. If you disagree, feel free to actually explain what part of my reasoning you disagree with, instead of throwing personal insults :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13np2sd/opinion_the_elderly_pregnant_and_disabled_have/

The ban mainly involves products such as spinach, parsley, broccoli and milk.The country's Food and Drug Administration will continue testing produce coming from Japan and will keep the public informed of its findings, the office said.Separately, **Singapore** said it found radioactive contamination in four samples of vegetables imported from Japan and has extended the ban to food from two more Japanese prefectures.Singapore's Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority said radioactive contamination was found in Mitsuba (Japanese wild parsley), Nanohana (rapeseed plant), Mizuna (Japanese mustard) and perilla leaf samples.The **New Zealand** Ministry of Forestry and Agriculture is also testing some Japanese food items for signs of nuclear contamination.South Korea on Monday expanded checks to include dried and processed foods imported from Japan. On Friday, Korea said it would ban imports of produce from radiation-affected areas with immediate effect. **Thailand** has expanded the scope of its tests and asked traders to avoid importing fruits and vegetables from Japan's Honshu island.**Other countries that have imposed restrictions on food imports from Japan include Australia and the United States.**While countries are stepping up efforts to stay vigilant, the potential for danger to human life through imported food is still considered limited as these are very mild levels of radiation.Singapore's AVA said in a statement that an adult will need to consume 3.5 kilograms of contaminated vegetables to receive a comparable level of radiation that is present in an X-ray. An adult individual will need to consume 184 kgs of contaminated vegetables to be exposed to as much radiation as a normal human being receives a year from direct sunlight and other normal sources.Moreover Japan is only a niche exporter of food and ships food products worth about $3 billion a year.Yet, fears of contaminated food may have an outsized impact on Japanese fresh-food exporters even though **contamination risk is currently restricted to the prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Chiba and Ehime**.If the crisis continues, it could be bad news for apple and strawberry exporters of Japan's Aomori and Miyagi prefectures and seafood and milk products exporters in general.Despite efforts by authorities to reassure people that the potential for contamination remains limited for now, the nuclear crisis is having a psychological impact on patrons of Japanese cuisine in Asia.""We used to get a lot of our fish and ingredients from Japan. Now we're faced with a situation where people don't want to eat food from Japan,"" Howard Lo, a sushi bar owner in Singapore, said on his blog.He said sales at his restaurant have dropped by half since the tragedy struck, even though for those food items that aren't stockpiled, he has already turned to supply from non-Japanese sources.Write toSameer Mohindru atsameer.mohindru@dowjones.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/165vaqx/more_countries_including_singapore_ban_import_of/

NTUC Income policyholders will soon be robbed by Allianz who can legally rob them under the T&Cs of their policies.An insurance company, at the end of the day, is a large pool of assets that are invested, most of which are eventually paid out in claims or benefits to policyholders. The market value of an insurance company is necessarily far smaller than the value of this pool of assets. Income Insurance is no different, and it holds billions in dollars of assets which effectively belong to their Singaporean policyholders. There are plenty of completely legal tricks Allianz can do to pocket this money without violating Income’s covenants with policyholders. For instance, many life insurance or endowment policies have a non-guaranteed benefit component upon maturity or death - and Income has likely accrued upwards of 8 billion in non-guaranteed benefit liabilities alone. All it takes for the rug to be pulled from these policyholders’ feet, is for Allianz to “invest” these monies “in good faith” \*wink wink nod nod\* in a way that benefits a Allianz-related counterparty. Income policyholders become an ATM for Allianz to book a near-immediate massive profit. This way, Allianz’s purchase of Income Insurance for 2.2 billion more than pays for itself. This arrangement reeks of unjust enrichment, and even if it goes through, there should be a microscopic level of regulatory monitoring to ensure that Allianz does not try to pull some shenanigans to legally fleece Income policyholders. Singapore’s regulatory framework regarding the corporate governance of insurance companies can be considered woefully inadequate. In a normal country, policyholders would be considered key stakeholders in an insurance company, and would have been able to veto the corporatization of NTUC Income, and the subsequent acquisition by Allianz. Ordinary Singaporeans purchased NTUC Income policies because they believed the government's message that NTUC Income had a social mission; to allow Allianz to fleece them now is a bait-and-switch of the most despicable nature, and 100% on the government if MAS allows this repugnant transaction to go through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1elc0kz/allianz_may_be_able_to_book_billions_in_immediate/

Later I found out that this is a common discriminatory practice in certain parts of Europe. For that case, it was found out and ended up with a extremely large settlement with the company. Of course, most likely such things won't happen in Singapore, but what if it happens? How do Singaporeans deal with it if there are similar cases?

MOE's response to this was:>When we tried your exploit on 31 May, we were not successful. MG informed us that a pre-scheduled patch had already been deployed end day 30 May.Well, ok, sure, noted.Full email: https://drive.proton.me/urls/KBN9PPB8NC#k5WxNAtK0MYU\---My intention in sharing the correspondence has never been about *this specific vulnerability*. Rather, it has been to raise concerns regarding the steps MOE has taken to ensure the security of our personal data. I am confident in MOE's ability to address this particular vulnerability and understand that it was not the cause of the recent incident.With that said, I would like to address some broader points related to MOE's commitment to security:* It's noteworthy that while a secondary school student discovered this vulnerability in under three hours, it appears that MOE's independent audits and regular cybersecurity testing took nearly three years to do so. Evidence suggests that this vulnerability may have been present as early as August 2021.* When I initially claimed that I suspected a security issue on 18 May, I noticed a significant delay in communication, with MOE taking several working days to respond to each email. It is not difficult, yet very important, to have someone monitor communications and respond in real-time for alleged security vulnerabilities like these.* While the vulnerability was discovered through an earlier security screening, it seems there was no immediate action taken to disable the Mobile Guardian system (e.g. logins or signups) to prevent potential exploitation of the vulnerability before it was patched.Cybersecurity ought to be taken more seriously than this. It is already less relevant how the recent hack happened and whether it was caused by a more sophisticated attack; the fact that this trivial vulnerability existed for several years should itself raise concerns. There are many important questions that MOE needs to answer here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eop8a0/dear_moe_we_really_need_to_talk_about/

(We have currently 40 (+1?), we used to have hundreds, rip the Mercedes 0405 bendies)Articulated buses were phased out to free space to park an expanding bus fleet. From our understanding, the articulated buses take up more space at bus stops. In addition, double decker buses provide bus capacity in a more cost-efficient manner than articulated buses. (Probably in response to my qns that we have the resources and space by SMRT to maintain and store bendies b4 BCM and LTA takeover)Once again, thank you for wrting to us and giving us the opportunity to clarify further.By the way, this was an email that dragged on a bit longer than usual, they emailed me saying they needed more time to gather info. I did also asked for the stats on electric buses, but dk is it ignore or still generating answer.Personal thoughts: Initially it makes sense, but I would still argue the need to have articulated buses in SG may have decreased but not zero. There are cases where double decker buses are nor efficient in certain areas. E.g. I remembered there was always a problem for buses like 179/196 where students would crowd in the area between the standing area and staircase to 2nd floor, so the bus driver has to shout at those to move back, students probably have the thought because their school is nearby, just camp the exit. Having articulated buses allows for better exit flow, incentives people to move back. B4 yall say 3 door DD buses, the 3rd door is kinda awkward, with the step and all, hence I still think we need proper three door bendies.Moving on, with the article where some elderly fell from climbing the stairs claiming they strong enough to climb, wouldn't having articulated buses half solve the problem, increased capacity but no stairs climbing so no falling risk. E.g. 302, I remember it plys CCK which quite a few Elderlies​, bendy buses were OK then, so what is the issue now?I also stated areas like Changi Airport with its low ceiling requires single decker buses, so bendies would still work, can be seen now on 858. I understand the routes can be limited, SBS had bad exp with a 14.5m long rigid body Volvo B10M, hence swearing to have buses no longer than 12m. But we will have to consider the passenger types more seriously, 20% senior population.  Sidenote: we still have a (singular) Hispano Habit Bendy, but cannot legally drive lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1d36js9/i_wrote_to_lta_on_bendy_buses_in_sg_here_is_their/

t3_15yxcvr,PAP policies and generational unfairness,reddit,Politics,2023-08-23 08:13:00,0.9827,"Let's take the new BTO housing model. It's a step in the right direction for the future. But my question is, doesn't it exacerbate inequalities between existing homeowners (whose govt subsidised flats are going to become rare and even more expensive commodities) and future homeowners (whose flats will be under the new scheme)? Why isn't the government doing anything about the existing homeowners who played the system to win a lottery prize? Instead, having acknowledged some of the deep unfairness in the system, the government has decided that only future homeowners will be subject to this new scheme which is meant to mitigate the lottery effect.In my opinion, the PAP's new policies are going to drive an increasingly bigger gulf between the haves and the have nots. The past generations who benefitted the most from the housing policies are going to continue to reap those benefits, at the expense of young people who find that housing have reached unaffordable levels and whose flats may never fetch the same kind of resale value as their seniors' or parents' flats. It's not just the housing policy. Another example that comes to mind is the working mother's child relief. This tax relief was substantially slashed for mothers earning more than 5k a month in Budget 2023 - oh but it only applies to mothers who give birth from 2024 onwards. These mothers are largely going to belong to the younger generation - the ones whose flats will likely be under the new BTO system too. Meanwhile, existing mums who are not planning to have any more kids continue to enjoy exponentially higher tax relief than new mums.So if you're a young person who doesn't have a flat or kids yet, you're really a lot worse off than those who came before you. If you get a Prime or Plus BTO flat, you will face a ton more resale conditions than those who bought their flats under the old schemes. Their flats will continue to appreciate. You will face difficulties selling your flat in the future that they never will. Meanwhile, you or your wife will be paying significantly higher income tax than them, assuming your / her income exceeds 5k a month.In essence, the have nots keep paying a higher and higher price. The haves are blissfully untouched or even benefit from the new policies. Is this fair?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15yxcvr/pap_policies_and_generational_unfairness/

FIN number.I this point I felt something is off and ended the call.I double checked the sum from the message and it was different from the one in the auto message.I‚Äôm pretty certain it was scam, but not 100% sure.My question are:1. Is it likely that DBS would ask me to approve a transaction in a call from Vietnam?2. Considering he was asking for my FIN, can I be certain it was indeed a scam?3. Him having my name and phone number- if it‚Äôs a scam, am I in trouble?(Don‚Äôt think so as this is available online, but I want to make sure)I‚Äôm mainly curious right now, and wondering what should I do next.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/16flb0l/i_think_i_was_just_almost_scammed_by_a_phone_call/

With the patients already in serious ill health and possibly recovering from surgery, could we be a little bit more sympathetic?Even if not implementing aircon across the board, I think while potentially tens of thousands of dollars of bills will be costly for many people, additional ~$10/day for aircon should be more affordable. \* Note: I don’t know exactly when these policies were set, but I found a 1969 milestone on the SGH website for the introduction of Class C charges. https://www.sgh.com.sg/about-us/corporate-profile/key-milestones-singapore-general-hospital",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cmxb1v/is_it_time_to_consider_aircon_for_b2c_wards/

Now, for the record, I barely take PHV, but it seems that at least for the past 3-4 times i've taken it, they've all had some variation of the ""claymore"" anti-personnel mine.Just today, I rode in one where the front of the steering wheel was meticulously lined with multiple ornamental rocks... leaving out space for the ""SRS AIRBAG"" label on the plastic part... In the event of a crash, that airbag is gonna deploy and send all of that rock as shrapnel into anything soft (i.e. driver and passenger).A month ago, I was in some cryptobro's Toyota Sienta. I respect the dude trying to hustle... bank account as his phone wallpaper, ""to the moon"" graph on his grab phone... and a giant, thick, solid metal porsche badge taped over the Toyota logo on the steering wheel. Now, it may just be me worrying but... in the event of a crash... that porsche badge is going to be launched straight at the driver's skill, or the passenger sitting behind him...Like I understand, ideal circumstances, a safe driver will not crash... but there's still the risk that another unsafe driver will slam into you, resulting in your airbags deploying and potentially killing the driver and/or passenger. I have also seen cars where the airbag cover on dashboard is covered in random bits and bobs, with some of them having insanely sharp religious objects. Again, a crash is going to launch that at really high speed and cause injuries/death.Personally, I feel we should have a safety inspection of vehicles used for PHV or commercial purposes. Having a system where you can cancel a booking if you perceive it ""not being safe"" might be helpful but is gonna be prone to misuse. But hey, that's probably just paranoid me being worried about my safety in the car of a stranger",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1f3hzcl/does_anyone_else_notice_the_increase_in_unsafe_phv/

it was a crowded bus stop some more with so many people.and out of all these ppl, you mean only a young girl would dare to say anything? i really wanted to stop crying but i was so embarrassed and that just made me feel worse. i boarded the bus and on the bus i was crying even more. i honestly don’t know why i was crying so much, i think i was just really overwhelmed. there were ppl who were at that bus stop who saw what happened and got on the bus w me. but typical singaporeans ofcourse they didnt say anything except stare at me even though i had tears rolling down my face. more than the man himself, i was mad at the bystanders of the bus stop for not saying anything. singaporeans love to throw arnd terms like “kampung spirit” but let’s be real, it barely exists these days. i’m sure people there knew what was happening was wrong but there’s 0 community spirit, there’s 0 willingness to help others. it’s so, so disappointing. my friends suggested that i should lodge an online police report even though it's unlikely that there will be any action against him as it's still considered a very minor incident. at least it will be on his record if he repeats this behaviour? i don't know what i should do, i'm not sure if it's worth the hassle. i used to be alot more passionate abt talking abt the prevalence of racism in sg when i was younger but as i got older, it just feels futile. if u want to understand, sure. but if u don't want to, i'm not gna waste my energy forcing u to understand. in my opinion, not enough people speak up about this because no one wants to be immediately classified as a ""wokeist"" or ""sjw"" what's the point. im tired of this",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cxvyod/got_racially_harassed_at_a_bus_stop_no_one_stood/

t3_z6i58u,"Some observations about the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), including underestimated travel timings on line maps and comparing its actual travel time with the North South Line (NSL)",reddit,Transport,2022-11-28 00:51:00,0.9876,"The Thomson-East Coast Line 3 has been open for more than two weeks. Since its opening, I have been taking the entire TEL up and down frequently, and have made some observations about the line.**1. How accurate are the travel times on platform line maps along the TEL?**Although the distance between two consecutive stations along the TEL is shorter in the city area, I still find it odd that it only takes 1 min to travel between most of them, especially when including the time that the trains dwell at the stations. For reference, I will embed the links to the platform line maps here:  [Woodlands North towards Gardens by the Bay](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QZ6j9nK7A6EvAUVaA)  [Gardens by the Bay towards Woodlands North](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f6Hw1YP95isdTPc77)I used the stopwatch on my phone to time the duration that the train takes to travel from one station to another and indeed, the actual duration is significantly larger than what is stated on the platform line maps, as stated in the tables below.When I recorded the data, all travel timings between two consecutive stations and dwell times at stations were taken at least 3 times each to ensure consistency and averaged. All timings were recorded outside of weekday peak hours, so I am not sure whether these timings will increase during weekday peak hours.To avoid making the post too long, I will post the travel and dwell times for individual stations separately in [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LO1lB0jptt8UJnlUYUd3KxYqSmKoyvIauf6DNYVlb5w/edit?usp=sharing) for those who are interested. The cumulative travel time for both directions is as follows.Cumulative Travel Time (From Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay)|Station|Line map|Actual time|Difference||:-|:-|:-|:-||Woodlands|2 min|1 min 43 s|− 17 s||Woodlands South|4 min|4 min 33 s|\+ 33 s||Springleaf|8 min|9 min 22 s|\+ 1 min 22 s||Lentor|11 min|12 min 32 s|\+ 1 min 32 s||Mayflower|13 min|14 min 57 s|\+ 1 min 57 s||Bright Hill|15 min|17 min 4 s|\+ 2 min 4 s||Upper Thomson|17 min|19 min 27 s|\+ 2 min 27 s||Caldecott|19 min|22 min 19 s|\+ 3 min 19 s||Stevens|23 min|26 min 11 s|\+ 3 min 11 s||Napier|25 min|29 min 30 s|\+ 4 min 30 s||Orchard Boulevard|26 min|31 min 21 s|\+ 5 min 21 s||Orchard|28 min|33 min 33 s|\+ 5 min 33 s||Great World|30 min|36 min 7 s|\+ 6 min 7 s||Havelock|31 min|37 min 52 s|\+ 6 min 52 s||Outram Park|33 min|39 min 55 s|\+ 6 min 55 s||Maxwell|34 min|41 min 50 s|\+ 7 min 50 s||Shenton Way|35 min|43 min 39 s|\+ 8 min 39 s||Marina Bay|36 min|45 min 20 s|\+ 9 min 20 s||Gardens by the Bay|40 min|48 min 40 s|\+ 8 min 40 s|Cumulative Travel Time (From Gardens by the Bay to Woodlands North)|Station|Line map|Actual time|Difference||:-|:-|:-|:-||Marina Bay|3 min|2 min 11 s|− 49 s||Shenton Way|4 min|4 min 24 s|\+ 24 s||Maxwell|5 min|6 min 14 s|\+ 1 min 14 s||Outram Park|6 min|8 min 0 s|\+ 2 min 0 s||Havelock|8 min|10 min 16 s|\+ 2 min 16 s||Great World|9 min|11 min 59 s|\+ 2 min 59 s||Orchard|11 min|14 min 13 s|\+ 3 min 13 s||Orchard Boulevard|13 min|16 min 23 s|\+ 3 min 23 s||Napier|14 min|18 min 15 s|\+ 4 min 15 s||Stevens|16 min|20 min 57 s|\+ 4 min 57 s||Caldecott|20 min|24 min 49 s|\+ 4 min 49 s||Upper Thomson|22 min|28 min 34 s|\+ 6 min 34 s||Bright Hill|24 min|30 min 56 s|\+ 6 min 56 s||Mayflower|26 min|32 min 58 s|\+ 6 min 58 s||Lentor|28 min|35 min 31 s|\+ 7 min 31 s||Springleaf|31 min|38 min 35 s|\+ 7 min 35 s||Woodlands South|35 min|43 min 34 s|\+ 8 min 34 s||Woodlands|37 min|45 min 41 s|\+ 8 min 41 s||Woodlands North|39 min|48 min 29 s|\+ 9 min 29 s|It seems that they also reduced the estimated travel times for TEL1 &amp; TEL2 after they opened TEL3. Someone told me that the platform line maps at Woodlands North and Caldecott used to state that it takes 23 min to travel between Woodlands North and Caldecott, which would have been more accurate, but now it states that it only takes 19 min to travel between these two stations. ~~Somehow the opening of TEL3 has made the trains travel faster lol.~~Therefore, do be more conservative if you are planning your travel time using the line map. Or perhaps you can just use the tables above.**2. Will taking the TEL instead of the NSL help you reach your destination faster?**Again, using the stopwatch on my phone, I timed the duration it takes for an NSL train to travel between stations where the NSL and TEL interchange (Woodlands, Orchard and Marina Bay). The results do show that it takes a shorter time to travel between Woodlands and Orchard when using the TEL rather than the NSL, but the time is almost similar for between Orchard and Marina Bay.Cumulative Travel Time (From Woodlands to Marina Bay)|Station|NSL line map|NSL actual time|TEL actual time||:-|:-|:-|:-||Arriving Orchard|37 min|35 min 55 s|30 min 48 s||Departing Orchard||36 min 53 s (Dwell time: 58 s)|31 min 50 s (Dwell time: 62 s)||Arriving Marina Bay|49 min|47 min 6 s|42 min 37 s|Cumulative Travel Time (From Marina Bay to Woodlands)|Station|NSL line map|NSL actual time|TEL actual time||:-|:-|:-|:-||Arriving Orchard|11 min|10 min 22 s|10 min 44 s||Departing Orchard||11 min 18 s (Dwell time: 56 s)|11 min 30 s (Dwell time: 46 s)||Arriving Woodlands|49 min|48 min 2 s|42 min 12 s|TEL time savings|Section|To Woodlands|To Marina Bay||:-|:-|:-||Between Woodlands and Orchard|6 min 2 s|5 min 7 s||Between Orchard and Marina Bay|−22 s|–34 s||Between Woodlands and Marina Bay|5 min 50 s|4 min 29 s|(Note that the time savings do not add up due to the difference in dwell times at Orchard)Therefore, commuters should take the TEL if they are solely taking the train between Orchard and Woodlands, but since the time saving is not that large, if their final destinations are nearer to the NSL stations, they should not change trains between TEL and NSL at Woodlands or Orchard since the time savings for TEL will likely be outweighed by transfer and waiting times.**3. Has the opening of TEL reduced crowding on the NSL?**Gone are the days when Northerners needed to jostle for space on NSL trains when an alternative option is now made available to them. Before TEL2 &amp; TEL3 were opened, it was common for commuters boarding the train at NSL northbound platform at Bishan during evening peak hours to wait for at least one more train before they could board, and platform queues may occasionally extend to the other end of the platform. However, this seems to no longer be the case. I have taken some photos (embed in the links) on [18 November (Friday), 7.16pm](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ujRHovRersb2VQPv5) and [21 November (Monday), 7.30pm](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PRXgUHTagynqgPFA8) during the evening peak hours which suggest that the crowding on the NSL has decreased significantly, and the decrease is more than what I expected (the eastern part of EWL did not seem to experience such a drastic drop in crowding when DTL3 opened), although part of the decrease may also be attributed to the school holidays and some remaining in the CBD for nightlife activities on Fridays.In fact, the crowding on the TEL is now pretty similar to the NSL, as you can see [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/F1ymm96ittxbWtAt5). Despite this, throughout the past two weeks, I have observed that no carriages displayed “yellow” on the “[Passenger Load Information System](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2018/5/2/factsheet-passenger-load-information-system-piloted-on-downtown-line-for-smoother-boarding.html)” (currently only available at the platforms of Downtown and Thomson-East Coast Lines), which suggests that the system is either faulty or it takes a lot for the system to turn “yellow” (then what is the point of the system when it is meant to divert passengers to less crowded carriages?).**Conclusion**The Thomson-East Coast Line aims to [bring residents along the North-South Corridor faster access to the city, relieve crowding on the North-South Line](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html) and [strengthen the resilience of our rail network by providing alternative travel routes for commuters on other lines](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2022/10/news-releases/thomson---east-coast-line-stage-3-to-open-for-passenger-service-.html). A few aspects of the TEL seem to be rushed/poorly done as already stated in this post, and also such as the cleanliness of trains (especially the dusty exterior) &amp; platform screen doors, and the [wrong platform line map used for the wrong station](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ys6n9y/how_did_this_happen_on_the_tel_its_not_exactly_a/). Despite this, I feel that it has done a pretty good job of achieving its aims. This is also evident when North East Line services were recently delayed twice on [15 November](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1592473146443313153) and [23 November](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1595354067521327104), and commuters were advised to [take the TEL to bypass the faulty section of the NEL](https://twitter.com/SBSTransit_Ltd/status/1592494302676267008). Hopefully, when the East Coast section of the TEL and other MRT lines open in the future, more people will have nearby access to an MRT station and enjoy faster public transport journeys to places they want to go, therefore achieving Singapore's [aims of a transport network that is convenient, well-connected and fast](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html).

For the past week, I've been getting scam/spam calls non-stop since last monday and I have no idea how they got my number. Just yesterday I got 11 calls and i've already gotten 3 today which is really frustrating cause my phone number is being used for work too and these scam calls makes it hard for me to know who are actual customers calling me or not. Cause the scammers are calling from numbers which don't have +65 in front. Curiousity got the better of me and I decided to answer one of them today and not talk at all to see if it really was scam calls or just a persistent survey/marketer. I heard phones ringing and faint conversations in the background, but it seems like the scammer that called me was also keeping quiet like me and ended the call after around 10 secs of this silence.More recently (and less frequently), I started getting whatsapp messages saying ""Hi, is this XX"" and XX is actually my real name and not my whatsapp name which blows my mind cause my phone number and name associated with it is not publicly listed online anywhere (I think so).I tried blocking and reporting numbers, PDPC DNC Registry, Scamshield, etc but they don't seem to work cause I'm still getting bombarded with these calls and messages.

Please talk to them and support them,reddit,Employment,2022-04-30 06:57:00,0.983,"Edit: I hope my post doesn’t come off as condescending or virtue signalling - it is genuinely meant to increase awareness of the plight of migrant workers and small things we can do to make it better for them. Apologies if you felt that way, but that is definitely not my intention!I am not sure if my post is going to gain much traction or if people here are going to be sympathetic. But this is my story.I started volunteering adhoc at ItsRainingRaincoats earlier this year, and came across so many migrant workers living in not-so-great conditions and going through a lot of mental anguish that you and I don’t have to face on a daily basis. Almost all of them pay hefty contract fees to agents in their home countries to come and work here, making peanuts every month. They need to pay back the agent fees while supporting their families. They get no subsidies on transport, food and daily expenses - a lot of them pay the same price as you and me for daily items like eggs, rice, etc. They get only one day of leave per month and frankly, the work they do is unsafe and backbreaking. Having not seen their family and other loved ones for 2+ years, they’re not in the best state of mind right now. The least we can do, as Singapore residents, is to talk to them as fellow humans. I’m not saying that you need to go out of your way to get them food, snacks or do favours for them - but just talk to them as a friend would. Find out more about their day. Ask them how they are. Treat them as an equal - all of us are in this country to make a better life for ourselves, whether we were born here or chose to live here. Today, I interacted with a migrant worker who’s painting our condo walls. It was just general chitchat, where I asked him about his work and family situation and how he breaks his fast everyday. He told me that I was the first one to interact with him (mind you, they’ve been working here for close to 1.5 months). I felt immensely guilty and ashamed - that I’d not done spoken to him sooner, and that other people haven’t spoken to him either. They paint the walls daily in harsh sunlight, getting no break in between.We all have our own biases - but this is my plea to go break them and look beyond them. E.g. a lot of people on this sub believe that they need to work harder so that BTO flats are ready on time, but that’s really not their fault and it’s silly to blame them in my opinion.Thanks if you read till here!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/uf5qid/migrant_workers_are_humans_too_please_talk_to/

t3_1418xit,How many of you are concerned with AI affecting or 'taking over' your jobs here in Singapore?,reddit,Technology,2023-06-05 09:40:00,0.9938,"Since jobs seems to always be a hot topic, and with generative AI now at a level of automation never before seen, I figured it'll be a good time to discuss about it here. For me doing photography, it'll definitely be a concern. Funny enough, I dreamt about having the tech for the longest time to create works of art I have in my head, but never the skill or time to master them. Especially useful for me also when trying to source for content for pitch decks & moodboards, midjourney is very helpful when the images don't exist on Pinterest, or the alternative is photobashing something in photoshop.I had wanted to study concept art drawing prior to apps like midjourney or stable diffusion, mostly because I'm a fan of seeing concept art, but also it'll help me in my own line of work doing commercial and portrait photography with some level of pre-visualisation. Now that the apps are here, I see little point in having to study it, not that I don't find it any less important, but for me personally, the apps fulfilled my own goals without having to fork out the money to study for it so intensively. If I'm in a place and time where I can potentially afford to do so, then sure.I won't deny that what midjourney can create is impressive and scary. Lifelike generated art of people, scenery and products will likely upend certain markets, or create even lesser demand for certain areas. Markets like stock images, corporate portraits (I'm in this as well so it'll affect me), fine art photography (again another area I'm in) and even product photography (there are apps now that can put products on a white backdrop without the need of professional photography equipment) will very likely be disrupted. Why pay more for these particular areas when you can generate it with AI? That will certainly be the direction some will have. The likely last to be affected will probably be events, wedding photography and photojournalism because unless we have another pandemic or some world ending scenario, events will always be happening. People want actual authentic photos of what happened. Of course that isn't gonna stop people from using AI, but probably to fix screw ups like blurry shots, sharpening etc. Beyond that, I could see art markets like artstation, deviantart and countless of online illustrators, voice artists, animators having their careers affected. Concept art painters are only maybe needed for final concept works, and earlier illustrations made with stuff like midjourney. Storyboard artists would probably be one of the most likely career to be most affect imo, because production houses can just generate it in an instant. I know writers will especially be affected by apps like ChatGPT. Companies will probably just have internal editors to just chatgpt articles rather than hire freelance writers for such roles. And also the office jobs as well, probably people in administration roles will be affected, especially when it's simple scheduling of tasks, spreadsheets etc. For me, I will work with it rather than going against it. I know, and know several friends who vehemently deny using AI for their work, that it isn't representative of the artist work. While I don't fully agree, I see where they come from. I've used midjourney to help me with generating moodboards, chatgpt for write ups, and then I'll edit it to become my own content, but I would let people know that they've been used. I would only use it in the context of helping me draft ideas and concepts for me, and never use it to represent my work. I think its a little ridiculous to say 'I've made it!' When really you just made prompts in midjourney. Or perhaps, if it does take over my work, I'll be happy to just change my career to something else. No point arguing, at least in my opinion if something does a better job than I do. Automation in the history of humanity had always  taken and create jobs, so I don't think this would be any different. Better to adapt than to become someone who's jaded and angry about how technology made you redundant (at least imo) Or maybe we'll have a resurgence, with how people still want authentic works of art rather than something machine made. Like how film is making some comeback right now. I guess if it disrupt enough jobs in a capitalist market, some form of UBI will probably emerge. So, what about you? Would like to hear your opinions. Tl;Dr: I am concerned as a photographer who's works may be affected, but I've also used it to help me. If the time comes where it's taken over, I'll move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1418xit/how_many_of_you_are_concerned_with_ai_affecting/

A few stalls with good and affordable food have moved out.I live near a wet market and it has been my source of relatively more affordable food, but it is going to be renovated soon and replaced with a new mixed development with a wet market and I'm sure price will go up a lot once they reopen.There is another hawker centre near my old house that still had $3.5 shredded chicken noodle. Found out that they are also under renovation now. I don't think they will still have those prices once they reopen.The Kopitiam was perfectly fine and still looked very new; why do they need to spend money to renovate and increase price?

Why do we need to tear down the whole thing and build something totally different?Just want to vent. I don't need swanky new things. I just want my food to be affordable.

Think again, says one property agent",reddit,Housing,2023-05-02 04:15:00,0.952,"According to property agent Shiddique Asyraaf, those two flat types, along with a low-floor unit facing a rubbish chute, are ones to stay clear of. In a TikTok video posted last Saturday (April 22), Asyraaf advised against buying a maisonette, as most of them are ‚Äúat least 30 years old"", which would make them difficult to sell less than 20 years on. ""The [executive maisonette] would be 50 years old [by then],"" he explained. ""For buyers who intend to fully utilise their CPF and loan up to the maximum valuation limit, they have to be at least 45 years old to buy an executive maisonette.""As a seller, this would limit the pool of buyers considerably, he said. Valuation limit refers to the purchase price, or the value of the property at the time, whichever is lower. Also, CPF funds may only be used up to a certain point depending on the age of the property.Not surprisingly, low-floor units facing the rubbish chute aren't the best option either.Asyraaf said these homes are ""one of the more challenging units to sell"", for obvious reasons. Units on the highest floor are typically popular among home buyers ‚Äì for the view they offer, and exposure to light and breeze, among other things.   But think again, said Asyraaf. The first issue is the heat due to exposure to the sun, he said. Then there‚Äôs the issue of the lift breakdowns.While many in the comments section agreed with his points regarding the maisonette and the chute-facing units, they seemed divided over the top-floor flats. Asyraaf advised first-time buyers on being clear on their priorities and preferences before going house shopping. Is having an MRT station nearby important? What amenities need to be close by? It‚Äôs probably wise to keep a lookout for clinics, schools and supermarkets.Then again, while a nearby hospital might sound handy, do consider the constant noise from ambulance sirens.",https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/hdb-unit-top-floor-think-again-says-one-property-agent

t3_1b8jpib,Open Discussion About My Recent Experience Job Searching as a Local and Government Policies,reddit,Employment,2024-03-07 11:06:00,0.8271,"I am a Singaporean with 8+ YOE tech working (software engineer/machine learning) currently working in a GLC as a lead.I have been applying and interviewing for a new role over the last two months taking advantage of the surge in openings at the start of each year. My experience has left me with a lot of doubts about the effectiveness of existing government policies (such as Employment Pass, MyCareersFuture, etc) for fair consideration of local jobseekers, and the moderation of immigrant workers to protect the local job market. As you may know, the current policy requires that employers put up the job posting on MCF for a period of 2 weeks, and to make an attempt to find suitable local candidates before they are allowed to apply for an EP for a foreign candidate.Recently, I experienced two cases where it felt like I was interviewed simply to justify the employer's application for an EP rather than being seriously considered. In one case with a local financial institution, the hiring manager reached out to me personally over email, (they had my email because I had previously applied for a role with them) inviting me to interview for a senior role in his team. The interview consisted of 3 rounds and was unusually simple for an SWE role at this level (no coding test or system design), just some superficial questions about my experience and familiarity with some tools. Which on hindsight is kind of a red flag. The other red flag was that I couldn't find a posting for the role on the company's career page, MCF or any other jobs portal back when I started the interview process. But just a week after I was done with the interviews and was ghosted by them, a posting for the role got put up on MCF implying that they now intend to apply for an EP. The other case was in another post that I made about a month ago where the salary range advertised on MCF was apparently false or not applicable to local:https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1aoyz1z/salary_ranges_on_mycareersfuture_and_lowballing/Cases like these show that existing policies may not only be just ineffective, but in my case actually worked against me since they take away time (for the interviews and preparations) that I could have spent preparing for and interviewing elsewhere.

I think it might’ve been better if the package was conducted during a social studies lesson,” she said. A junior college teacher of seven years said a class taught by his school’s CCE head turned tense when students raised questions about Israel’s shelling of civilian targets, such as hospitals, in Gaza.The two were among more than 20 teachers and principals from primary and secondary schools and junior colleges that The Straits Times interviewed about the lessons, which the Ministry of Education (MOE) rolled out in mid-February 2024.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the majority of the teachers interviewed – who were of all ethnicities and had between two and 26 years of teaching experience – shared various concerns, including feeling ill-prepared and worried about backlash from parents. They also felt the content they were provided did not have enough historical context and was oversimplistic. CCE lessons cover a range of contemporary issues, including mental well-being and casual racism. But the latest lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict have become a lightning rod for criticism, with parents also raising concerns over the teaching material.At least two PAP MPs – Ms Nadia Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) – and Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency Members Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai have filed questions about the lessons, which will be answered in Parliament this week.Teachers told ST that MOE is relooking the material and that some schools have postponed the lessons, which were originally meant to be conducted before the end of term on March 8.Some school leaders have also held assembly sessions for students first to set the context of the lesson, before breaking into class discussions that teachers facilitate.  Veteran teachers said the “sensitive” lesson not only touches on history, geopolitics and international law, it also demands that teachers handle classroom discussions skilfully.Their concerns mirror a struggle that educators elsewhere, including in the United States and Britain, are also facing as they try to tackle conversations both in and out of the classroom about the polarising and emotionally charged topic.Still, most teachers here said the lesson was well intentioned, and some added that it was necessary. Others welcomed the mandate to open a formal discussion on an issue of “global interest”, especially if it can help students make sense of it.Ms Eng Yuwen, 35, a General Paper teacher, said she expects difficult questions from students, and believes the lesson is “necessary and important”. “A good number of our students live on social media, a habit that might expose them to unreliable sources of news and polarised views,” she said.“It’s also an opportunity to model for them how we can feel strongly about an issue and still respond in a measured manner, being sensitive to those around us. We can acknowledge the atrocities of war without picking a side,” she added.While emotions may run high, it also means “our youth are aware, concerned about fellow mankind and are eager to effect change”, said Ms Eng, who has been teaching for about seven years. “I would hope that as a class, we can hold space for anyone who needs to speak up without fear of judgment.”Similarly, one language arts teacher, with 26 years of teaching experience, felt that students should learn “the importance of considering multiple perspectives and the complexities of an issue”.“We also need to understand why Singapore as a nation takes a certain stance and how it affects national interest,” he said. Said an English language teacher of 15 years: “Having lived through 9/11, I am able to understand the objective of this lesson.” He was referring to the aftermath of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, and hopes students come to appreciate the harmony and peace in Singapore.But many teachers felt they were not sufficiently equipped to carry out the lesson, even if they understood its objectives.“No one can call themselves trained to facilitate the discussion when the training was barely an hour plus,” said one social studies teacher of 10 years, echoing sentiments that workshops were not enough to prepare teachers. A secondary school mathematics teacher with 15 years of experience said she found the class “very hard to teach” because the issues were too volatile, and she was not “confident to deal with questions or issues raised in class”.Nine teachers told ST that they objected to the framing of the issue, which begins its discussion of the conflict mainly from Oct 7, 2023, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.A secondary school humanities teacher of two years said this failed to discuss the full history of the conflict, “which can be misleading to students about blame and responsibility”.After Hamas’ Oct 7 attack, Israel retaliated with an air and ground campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 30,000 people, most of them women and children. More than 85 per cent of 2.3 million Gazans have also been displaced from their homes.Another secondary school teacher with 14 years of experience said the materials given do not include facts such as the International Court of Justice’s ruling in January that Israel must prevent acts of genocide in Gaza, and international calls for a ceasefire.“I know of teachers, including myself, who were on the receiving end of parents’ anger. We were called names (like) stupid, government puppets or dogs, when we had no control of the materials and weren’t consulted for our opinion about this package before it was rolled out,” said the teacher.Another teacher of five years said the discussion questions were “superficial” and felt more like a sharing of the national perspective, rather than a genuine discussion. Teachers also said they were given instructions not to tweak the slides. The teacher of five years said this was unusual and “sent the very wrong signal that it was more about MOE trying to communicate certain perspectives”.It also left teachers in a difficult spot if students raised information they found online during the classroom discussion. MOE has said the lessons aim to give students a “safe space” to understand the complex situation, develop their own views and appreciate diverse perspectives involved.It added that teachers do not impose their personal views on students or advocate the interests of any particular party. In an earlier media interview, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing had acknowledged the challenges of educators in carrying out the lesson, and said that MOE’s CCE branch will support them where necessary.He also said the CCE lessons were not meant to be a history lesson or to ascribe blame, but are instead intended to promote mutual understanding and social harmony.“The purpose of education is not to spread anger and hatred. It is to inculcate knowledge, understanding and empathy for all human beings, regardless of race or creed,” he said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/some-see-the-need-some-feel-unprepared-teachers-navigate-the-israel-hamas-conflict-in-classrooms

t3_1453frv,Is it legal to be penalised for rejecting an awarded tenancy?,reddit,Legal,2023-06-09 12:05:00,0.9765,"I participated in a tender bid for a unit late 2022 to run a franchise (closing date 29 Nov). The marketing kit for said unit stated that the unit will be available in December 2022 so I bidded a fair amount to get the unit. After almost 6 months (impt), i received notification that i am successful in my bid and am awarded the retail unit.Thing is, in the six months, the franchisor has had a corporate shift and is no longer accepting new franchises. I informed the landlord about this and they said no problem, just try your best to persuade the franchisor. In the meantime, they are preparing the letter of offer and tenancy agreement, and they told me to meet them to receive the documents even though i told them i will likely not proceed with the bid since i am unable to operate the franchise (to propose a new product will require another 6 months of review and approval from landlord).I met the landlord's representative to receive the letter of offer and TA, and asked the franchisor for advice, since in the documents received, it was stated that i will be penalised if i didnt sign and return the documents within 7 days. Franchisor told me to inform the landlord i will have to withdraw from the bid as i will not be awarded the franchise, which i immediately informed on the same day.I recently received an invoice demanding payment for 1 month's rental for thw withdrawal. According to the landlord, it is stated in the bidding document that the bidding offer is valid for 6 months, since i was informed 3 weeks shy of the 6 months that i am awarded the bid, i am liable to pay the penalty. Also, i had apparently failed to accept and return the signed TA and letter of offer, which is another reason for them to charge me the penalty. In the letter of offer, signing it means to accept the offer, whence i had informed the landlord that i am withdrawing on the same day i received the documents!Is it legal for the landlord to charge me the penalty even though i am unable to operate the proposed franchise because of being denied by the franchisor? I hadn't pay the franchise fee because the franchisor wasn't sure i will get the unit and gave up waiting after 3 months.Edit: their asking bid was 2800 and i bidded for 3500",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1453frv/is_it_legal_to_be_penalised_for_rejecting_an/

Chan Chun Sing (CCS) has also [stated](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/chan-chun-sing-support-teachers-well-being-2932666) that MOE values its teachers and pays close attention to their well-being and work-life balance and has taken steps to help teachers manage their workload.With that being said, MOE has also acted to increase the workload of teachers by [implementing](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20220307-empowering-educators-to-steward-change-and-shifting-mindsets-through-strong-partnerships) the likes of *""Wellness Ambassadors""*, addressing mental health and workload issues via a chatbot (and counselling hotlines) and [sending](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sending-teachers-work-attachments-outside-education-sector-requires-collective-effort-chan-chun-sing-2937996) teachers on industry attachments to give them a break.CCS has also made [statements](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cap-teachers-working-hours-1838626) like *""A hard cap on teachers' working hours is unrealistic""* when asked if they would consider a hard cap on teachers’ working hours and vague, non-committal [claims](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/chan-chun-sing-support-teachers-well-being-2932666) like *""streamline processes to make best use of resources""* and *""build shared responsibility with parents and community""* in response to a question on whether MOE has plans to reduce admin, non-teaching workload for teachers.Mrs Chua-Lim Yen Ching, Deputy Director-General of Education on the topic of stress from performance appraisals acknowledged that there are gaps in the system, but goes on to [say](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/my-mental-health-all-time-low-teachers-talk-burnout-moe-aware-gaps-need-plugging-2157151) *""So that at the end of the day, I may give you a grade, you may not be happy, but you can accept it,""*.

This differs from MOE's sentiments that teachers are able to cope with their workload.A quarter of teachers reported working more than 60 hours a week - that is 12 hour, 5 day workweeks OR 8.5 hour, 7 day workweeks. But Chan Chun Sing thinks that a hard cap on working hours is unrealistic as teachers will still go beyond the call of duty to attend to their students' needs. But how much of that 60 hour workweek is spent on additional administrative tasks remains to be seen.Teachers shared that the top 2 issues they faced are 1) Lack of work life balance and 2) Excessive workload. Teachers reported finding it hard to establish and maintain boundaries between their professional and personal lives. They also mentioned about excessive workloads brought about by current teacher-student ratios and administrative duties like CCA or event planning.Chan Chun Sing when asked about excessive workload mentions vaguely about streamlining processes and giving autonomy to schools without elaborating on how these could help with the marking load or event planning issues brought up by teachers.  The previous education minister also [insinuated that our teachers are not experienced enough to make smaller class sizes work](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-cautious-issue-smaller-class-sizes-ong-ye-kung) and cites studies that say smaller class sizes do not relate to better achievement, but ignores all the others that show a positive correlation.With increasing numbers of special education needs (SEN) students in mainstream schools, teachers are stretched even thinner with regards to classroom management and ensuring that all students keep up with the curriculum.A sizeable portion also perceived systemic challenges such as a perceived lack of empathy from management due to the management's lack of understanding of their stress. But yet, MOE expects teachers to raise their concerns about burnout or mental health issues with their school leaders whom are also directly involved in appraising them, determining their bonuses and career progression. It's no wonder that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers who resigned pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving, or that only 10.8% of teachers turn to their supervisors as a source of support for workplace stress.No amount of mental health counselling, process streamlining or school autonomy to roll out new initiatives at their own pace will help improve our teachers' lives unless the bulk of additional administrative work (CCA/event planning or late-evening meetings) is addressed. Pushing the responsibility to [parents](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/respect-from-parents-also-key-for-teachers-well-being-chan-chun-sing) or school [alumni](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/school-alumni-can-help-ease-the-workload-of-teachers-says-chan-chun-sing) also does absolutely nothing to address these systemic issues.It's also laughable that MOE uses statistics from internal surveys, exit interviews and teachers' [responses](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cap-teachers-working-hours-1838626) to the minister as an accurate way to paint the situation on the ground. As though teachers would want to look incompetent, burn bridges or dare tell the minister that his ideals are anchored in la-la-land.If it was true that 7 in 10 teachers can cope with their workload or that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs, why did the survey conducted by SCC uncover that 81.1% of teachers had their mental health affected, 78.6% of teachers found their work-life balance lacking and 78% of teachers highlighting a longstanding problem with excessive workload?*\*All statistics and quotes were sourced from publicly available resources, with everything else being an opinion of the author and should not be taken as facts.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/y3pa63/chan_chun_sings_moe_is_critically_out_of_touch/

t3_s674vp,Why does conscription in Singapore last so long?,reddit,Politics,2022-01-17 15:52:00,-0.9936,"Singapore is has one of the longest conscriptions in the world, even longer than countries actively threatened by its neighbours. For comparison:Israel: [30 months active service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel) active service. Reservists can be called up but are virtually not in any year unless there is a crisis.Military Situation: Israel's political situation is always tense and violent. Neighbouring countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran do not recognise it as a legitimate state. Since its creation Israel in 1948 has fought eight major wars, many smaller uprisings and low-level insurgencies in the Middle East. Israel is routinely attacked by insurgents through bombings, artillery and guerilla fighters and deploys its military beyond its borders to fight these insurgents.South Korea: [Up to 21 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea) active service. Reservists may be called up for up to 4 years on the Mobilization Reserve and up to 8 on the Homeland Reserve.Military Situation: South Korea is in a de facto state of war with North Korea, a nuclear armed rogue state under an absolute dictaroship with a million man active army. It has fought one major war, the Korean war, where North Korea invaded it to try and seize control. Since then several rare skirmishes at the DMZ have occurred. North Korea routinely threatens to invade and even use nuclear missiles.Taiwan: [Officially abolished in 2018, but Taiwanese males still serve 4 months of conscription.](https://thediplomat.com/2019/08/taiwans-all-volunteer-force-transition-still-a-challenge/)Military Situation: Taiwan is considered a rogue province by mainland China. It has fought in the Chinese Civil War which ended in 1949 and three Strait crisis between it and China. China plans to one day reunify Taiwan and [has never ruled out using military force to do so.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58854081) Chinese airplanes enter Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone daily. The CCP also heavily punishes any country recognising Taiwan in any way, including an famous visit by Lee Hsien Long to Taiwan which China raised a furor at.Singapore: 22-24 months, plus approximately six months call up reservist. Can be called up up till the age of 40 for non-officers and 50 for officers.Military Situation: Since independence Singapore has had one low-level conflict with Indonesia during Konfrontasi which ended in 1965 when Indonesian President Sukarno was deposed in a coup by the Indonesian military. Konfrontasi ended just one month after Singapore became independent. Singapore maintains friendly relations with all its neighbors including free trade, diplomatic visits and joint military exchanges. The tensest time in Singapore's history would be during the 1991 National Day Parade, when Malaysia and Indonesia conducted a paratrooper exercise with 300 paratroopers 20km from the border.Why is Singapore special? Our total service period is approximately 30 months which is as high as Israel and much higher than Taiwan/South Korea. Yet we are in much less danger.  EDIT: A lot of good arguments from both sides, but what we all seem to agree on is that minimally NSFs should be paid more to recognise their contribution and to partially offset the lost income suffered, especially for NSFs from working class families who need it the most. If civil servant pay all pegged to private industry, so why not do the same for NSF? Use a basic $10/hr full time salary in private industry as a basis. Eight hours a day, five days a week for fifty two weeks a year. That's a 1.7k basic pay a month for NSF.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/s674vp/why_does_conscription_in_singapore_last_so_long/

t3_1713n5j,The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated,reddit,Transport,2023-10-06 04:57:00,0.932,"One thing I've noticed with the PR effort, and likely by extension, the policy thinking, around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive. Have you seen the posters? ""Give your car a break - take TEL3"".Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/Uploads/Investor_Relations/AGM/sbst_agm_minutes_2019.pdf) that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA's ridership estimates of 500k. That it still produces losses in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.Consequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.Firstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and since waiting time is a KPI, bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs. We've all seen and complained about bus bunching. Breaking these long routes to reduce bus travel time should happen.Secondly, in the north and soon east, reconsider the regional relevance of the City Direct system and other similar services (850E, 951E, 982E, etc), travelling on expressways to the CBD during peak periods. Peak-period expressway congestion results in longer travel time compared to the off-peak ideal, which means bus companies, again, have to devote more resources to ensure a consistent waiting time and punctual departures. By shifting these to the MRT system, bus resources can be conserved to improve intratown and short-distance travel.Thirdly, there must be consideration on beefing up local services to better connect people to new lines. It took five years to provide a DTL connection to residents of Bedok North Ave 4 with the amendment of Service 18 only done in 2022. This ignorance of MRT connections still exists, with the new [Service 163B](https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/news/introduction-of-service-163b) literally ending one stop short of Lentor MRT. This means that there is no additional capacity, or reason, for Sengkang residents to use the TEL to avoid the NEL.Fourthly, travel times. Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal. Bus-only systems in other cities also suffer from the same problems, and that's why Ong Teng Cheong pushed to have the MRT built. There is space to optimize the MRT service and it should be taken. Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this. Lastly, all of us must also realize that there are other factors such as reliability and punctuality, which the MRT can do better; and as Singapore's workforce shrinks and labor costs increase, automated MRT lines are the solution to managing these costs. In contrast, new bus depots under construction even contain foreign worker dorms, indicating that the LTA foresees we will still need to import foreign bus drivers en masse.The ~150 buses or so in storage pale in comparison to the billions of dollars spent on MRT lines that so far remain underused. The DTL costs $20 billion, the TEL $25 billion, and that's before operating subsidies paid out to keep the lines afloat. We are opening new MRT lines every year until 2032, and if they don't learn this lesson now, they may be bleeding out on the CRL; with CRL designed more for relieving the existing network than providing new access.Ottawa even had to break their bus-only system, replacing it with a train. A majority of bus services were cut back to the train terminals instead of going to downtown Ottawa, and they're a much smaller city than us. Planned extensions to the Ottawa O-Train also include pushing the bus terminals further back into line extensions, to split them up and prevent them from congesting a given terminal.Opening a new rail line every year literally means we need to do something like this every year, but that is not happening. The expectation of ""build it and the car drivers will come"", which served us well during the NSEWL and perhaps NEL years, is no longer relevant - all the more so when bus companies were able to see the impact of the coming MRT then and adapt their networks accordingly.Now you wonder why transport ministers keep talking about sustainability, but so far it seems to be all talk and no action. If MOT wants to cut public transport costs, this is where it should start, by recognizing the impact of the MRT early and taking proactive steps to manage it. There's probably more than 10 years worth of adaptation to be made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/
t3_14vxaii,Opinion: Road accidents are as much the driver‚Äôs fault as they are the road designer‚Äôs,reddit,Transport,2023-07-10 15:31:00,0.829,"I read this take in a book on car dependency/centricity and I couldn‚Äôt help but keep thinking about it in light of the recent spate of vehicular accidents causing serious injuries/death.Yes, a portion of blame must lie on the operator of the vehicle, for speeding, for driving recklessly, for being under the influence, etc.But it‚Äôs well documented that drivers drive as fast as they feel safe to. This is why the US has such a high rate of road injuries/death - in the early days, planners believe that building wide straight roads in non-highway use cases (stroads) will reduce the room for error and make it safer. But such accommodating road designs just encourage faster driving which result in higher fatalities.Singapore has plenty of stroads. Upper Thompson Road, Sims Ave, Yio Chu Kang Road, Upper Serangoon Road, etc. They are so easy to speed on because they are so accommodating to cars. It‚Äôs such a shame because Sims Ave and Upper Serangoon Road could have been such interesting streets, lined with shophouses, but instead they are human-hostile stroads with 4(?) lanes of traffic and tiny narrow sidewalks.Hypothetically, if our roads looked more like central London‚Äôs, or Manhattan‚Äôs, we would probably have a lot fewer accidents and casualties, because the roads inherently discourage speeding. How do you speed when the road is narrow, twisty, and short? I‚Äôm not saying we should replicate London‚Äôs roads, but this is a trade off that is worth considering. How much more do we want to accommodate a minority of the population by making it easy to drive fast at the expense of other road users and pedestrians?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14vxaii/opinion_road_accidents_are_as_much_the_drivers/

The industry consultation will be held  from January to April 2024.  2. With increasing demand for  healthcare services due to an ageing population, acute hospital bed  capacity needs to be increased in both the public and private healthcare  sectors. The new not-for-profit private acute hospital model is meant  to provide more options for Singaporeans who wish to seek care in the  private healthcare sector.  3. The private acute hospital model will incorporate the following features:  a.  Not-for-profit, i.e., profits are not distributed to its shareholders  and are instead reinvested to the hospital and/or for charitable and  other not-for-profit activities;   b. Provide appropriate and affordable care to patients, with a stronger emphasis on cost efficiency and value;   c. Focus on serving mainly Singapore Residents; and  d. Provide some subsidised acute bed capacity.  4.  Participants of the industry consultation will be invited to provide  feedback on the proposed acute hospital requirements and suggest ideas  on how the key objectives for the new hospital model can be achieved.  More details will be released to participants upon successful  registration.  5. Interested private healthcare operators can register their interest at  [https://go.gov.sg/ptehospconsult](https://go.gov.sg/ptehospconsult). Registration will close on 21 January 2024.

There are [studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/911) to suggest that universal school meals have a positive impact on student well-being and performance.Could introducing universal free school meals here in Singapore subsized by the state be helpful or useful as a form of additional benefits for parents?We know that increasing TFR is a government goal, and that they are increasing benefits for parents and kids. State subsidized school meals would help lower the costs of raising a kid for families.I think that having access to meals should be a right for Singaporean students, and the simplest way to go about doing so would be universal school meals. This will ensure all students will have the nutrition they need, and would benefit students of all income groups.Growing up, there were stories about how underprivileged kids would go to school hungry and sate their hunger by drinking loads of water. There are also instances of underprivileged students not showing up for school because their parents could not give them allowances. Universal school meals could be a way to encourage their attendance.Universal school meals is also easier to manage with less administrative processing and has fewer opportunity for abuse compared to current MOE Financial Assistance Scheme.In NS the meals are fully catered, so culturally acceptance should not be an issue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ew3l5u/free_school_meals_in_singapore/

We actually topped Asia with data from a global health study but apparently a 2020 local study highlighted that we may be underestimating the estimates themselves...Worst thing was that the study mentioned that only ""1.6% of those who screened positive for an ED reported currently being in treatment"". As far as I know, only SGH has a dedicated treatment facility (KKH has doctors dealing with ED but not a dedicated team like SGH I think) and IMH isn't well-equipped either.   We keep saying that we should care more about mental health and stuff but I don't really see much being done per se to support facilities, infrastructure, outreach etc. More importantly, the stigma is still very much prevalent here...

t3_15z3qz5,"What if we could buy resale HDBs at cost price, without affecting the resale market?",reddit,Housing,2023-08-23 13:20:00,0.9587,"The idea came about as I was looking at resale prices being 2 to 3 times the BTO price of recently MOPed estates. I was not ready to sacrifice this much liquidity into a house, one in which I most likely will want to stay in forever and not looking to flip. As a result, I felt the amount of money I use to buy the house is seen as a sunk cost. I thought to myself, what if there was a scheme to buy resale HDBs that allows buyers who **do not intend to resell their houses for profit** to get a flat at near BTO cost price but more importantly should not affect existing homeowner's resale prices and demand.With the recent Standard, Plus and Prime categories, I call this scheme the HDB Lite scheme.To start off, both buyer and seller must let the HDB act as the middleman for the transaction.### Purchase of Lite flats1. Seller approaches HDB to sell back the flat at resale value. This resale value is determined by HDB and will of course be lower than reselling on the private market but the variance shouldn't be too high. Seller is **not subject to resale levy**. This is the incentive for sellers.1. HDB will post a listing of the flat. The flat's value reverts to its BTO price, adjusted for depreciation and inflation which is again determined by HDB.1. Buyer decides to buy the flat. Now here are the conditions for a home buyer under this scheme (let's call it HDB Lite)  1. MOP is forever.  1. Only room rental is allowed, and rental cost is determined by HDB based on market rate. HDB takes a cut of the rental, and balance of which is credited into CPF.  1. 20% downpayment required, of which all of it must be in cash. No full payments, no early repayment.  1. Loan is required, and will be at a higher interest rate than your standard HDB loan of 2.6%. This is because HDB initially takes a loss due to buying the flat at resale value.  1. Buyer and their partner must be registered with a 50:50 ownership. This is to prevent the spouse from purchasing another property while under benefits of the Lite scheme.The reason for the conditions is to allow HDB to claw back its loss from purchasing the flat from the seller via interest rates. My idea is not perfect, as it does not account for a lot of edge cases that would make HDB and thereby the taxpayer the losing party in this transaction.### For the resale of Lite flats.For selling of Lite flats, they can remain as Lite flats or converted to Standard flats. The seller under this Lite scheme will only be able to sell their flats to others via HDB. #### Lite-to-Lite  1. The seller must at the same time purchase another house to stay in via HDB Contra Facility. The new house can be a Standard HDB.  1. Upon selling, all proceeds are immediately deposited into CPF. No cash. This is to prevent sellers from using this Lite scheme as a means to speculate and profit. The idea of this scheme is to provide affordable housing, not for investment.  1. The flat's value reverts to its BTO price, adjusted for depreciation and inflation.  1. Any renovation or upgrade works done by the seller is taken into account, and increases the value of the house **up to a ceiling**.  1. Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay the outstanding loan of the seller first, with an early repayment penalty.#### For Lite-to-Standard sales:1. The seller under this Lite scheme will only be able to sell their flats to others via HDB.  1. Same, must utilize HDB Contra Facility to ensure you have a place to stay  1. Flat value is assessed to be at the private resale market rate, based on HDB's valuation. Of course, this only applies to the buyer's point of view. From the seller's POV, same as selling from Lite-to-Lite.  1. Any renovation or upgrade works done by the seller is taken into account, and increases the value of the house  1. Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay the outstanding loan of the seller first, however there is **no early repayment penalty** to incentivize selling to a Standard buyer and not lock up the supply of flats### Upgrading from Lite to StandardWhat if the homeowner decides to treat his existing home as an asset for flipping or to hand it down to his children? There is an avenue, again with tons of caveats.    1. The flat must first be ""sold"" at a Lite valuation.  1. The flat is then assessed based on private resale market rate, based on HDB's valuation.  1. Renovation or upgrade works will not be taken into account for valuation of the flat  1. The Lite sale proceeds are immediately used to fund the Standard purchase. No early repayment penalty. You are essentially rebuying your existing house, except now it has no more restrictions  1. Sales incur a resale levy, and the new flat's downpayment must be financed through HDB loan. This time, full payment is allowed but subject to penalties.The ideas and figures/percentages are just a rough gauges on what I thought would allow this scheme to work. I am definitely biased as a buyer looking to purchase a resale flat, so let me know your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15z3qz5/what_if_we_could_buy_resale_hdbs_at_cost_price/

In June, an independent certified penetration tester conducted a further assessment, and no such vulnerability was detected,” said the spokesperson.> TechCrunch was provided a video — recorded on May 30, the day of disclosure — demonstrating how the bug works. The video shows the user creating a “super admin” account using only the browser’s in-built tools to modify the network traffic containing the user’s role to elevate that account’s access from “admin” to “super admin.” The video showed the server accepting the modified network request, and when logged in as that newly created “super admin” user account, granted access to a dashboard displaying lists of Mobile Guardian enrolled schools.Mobile Guardian CEO Patrick Lawson did not respond to multiple requests for comment prior to publication, including questions about the student’s vulnerability report and whether the company fixed the bug.",https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/09/student-raised-security-concerns-in-mobile-guardian-mdm-weeks-before-cyberattack/

t3_1cax9w3,I genuinely hope the tragic Tampines crash will force a safer redesign of Singapore roads,reddit,Transport,2024-04-23 14:02:00,-0.9678,"After reading about it, and seeing the dash cam footage, I had trouble falling asleep last night. The footage was raw and traumatic and to know that within that few frames, 2 people have died, was very disturbing. It was such fucking senseless violence, and because of the egos and recklessness of a couple of assholes, innocent lives are lost. I’m not going to call it an accident. Traffic safety advocates discourage the phrase “traffic accident”. You can read about it [here](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/8995151/crash-not-accident), but the TLDR is that these crashes are not inevitable, they are preventable with safer road design. Just a few months ago, [a 4 year old girl was killed in River Valley along a road where drivers commonly speed](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/river-valley-institution-hill-car-accident-four-year-old-girl-died-4084356). And there is no shortage of many more crashes with cyclists, pedestrians, other road users, skids, etc.It is no surprise to anyone that speeding kills. And our laws against driving infractions are way too lax, yes. But that’s a separate topic for another discussion, however valid and warranted it may be.The probability of serious injury and death increases exponentially with vehicular speed. A car driving at double the speed has 4x the amount of kinetic energy. Speeding increases both the frequency and severity of crashes. As much as punishment feels right and just, we need to redesign our roads to prevent speeding in the first place. It is well established that the majority of drivers don’t drive at the posted speed limit, they drive at a speed that feels comfortable given the driving conditions of the environment. And a lot of Singapore’s roads are designed to be straight and wide to optimize for vehicular flow.  The old thinking was that you can reduce crashes by making driving “easier” - but studies after studies have shown this is not the case, because the safer it feels, the faster drivers drive, and the deadlier the outcomes. So road design that tells you to go fast, coupled with spotty enforcement, is just going to result in lots of speeding.In Netherlands, they pioneered a new road design known as [“naked streets”](https://streetswithoutcars.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/naked-streets/) where all hard safety measures are removed in residential streets. It reduced congestion, decreased crashes, and had the side benefit of increased traffic flow. That concept has been successfully applied around the world too.I’m not suggesting replacing every street with that. Clearly there are other considerations at play, and other road designs. I’m not a traffic engineer or urban planner. But the status quo of wide roads, fast cars, and preventable crashes is clearly untenable. LTA needs to seriously reevaluate current road design and adopt best practices from globally leading cities in this area. I read/watched somewhere that our straight wide road designs were a page out of the US’s road design playbook - if this is true, it’s a nasty path to tread down, because US cities are some of the worst in road safety among developed nations.Credit where it is due - the Silver Zone neighborhoods that LTA is pioneering are pretty pleasant. But that should be the default, not only in specially designated areas. Even the so called car-lite Tengah is terribly car-centric.Honestly, I don’t know what we can do as individuals. I’ve written in to LTA but I don’t know how seriously they take it. I just wanted to get this off my chest because each additional senseless loss of life is one too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cax9w3/i_genuinely_hope_the_tragic_tampines_crash_will/

Singapore come a long way since then but we cannot take racial harmony for granted. Past few years our racial/religious relations got slightly worse. When pandemic started, got a lot of anti-Chinese racism overseas (even some cases in Singapore) + Malaysia political crisis also started. Restrictions (like circuit breaker) cause a lot of economic hardship + social hardship (no Hari Raya visits). Many disadvantaged Singaporean families become reliant on Chinese/Malay-language social media.2021 Delta variant caused a lot of racism against Indians including one violent attack + more restrictions led to more economic/social hardship (Hari Raya kena cancelled again). PSP keep raising CECA issue which spark concerns about racism against Indians. As more Singaporeans get vaccine gahmen introduce SMMs based on vaccine status but got pushback from small groups of anti-vaxxers (mainly Christians influenced by Trump ideology). Many traditional Chinese kena brainwash by China propaganda on Chinese-language social media. 2022 start with Christian teen detained under ISA for plans to attack mosques then start of Russia-Ukraine war. Severe inflation push many disadvantaged Singaporean families to/beyond breaking point. Malay-language social media mood of desperation and insecurity due to economic/social hardship + cases of employment racial discrimination + fear of extremism from Chinese (started with China propaganda but got worse after 377A repeal but many LGBT/supporter indicate want to push for more). This make some receptive to Malaysia propaganda (which Singapore Malay community strongly rejected for decades) spreading during their election.In 2023 inflation remained high. A few incidents involving politicians (mostly minority races) spark some concerns and conspiracy theories. On Racial Harmony Day an Indian policeman commit suicide after making public claims about workplace racism. Then the Hamas attack  on Israel sparked a new war in Gaza. By then Malaysia propaganda and even extremist groups learn how to effective exploit the desperation/insecurity/hardship in many low SES Malay Singaporeans.So far 2024 is good with less severe inflation and no new major shocks. Gahmen will allow cats in HDB flats + working out details for workplace anti-discrimination laws (continues their damage control like allowing nurses to wear tudung in 2021 + Tharman winning president election in 2023). Of course still got risk of new major shock in second half of 2024.This Racial Harmony Day I hope our racial harmony will improve and we can do things to protect/improve it.

We'd need to determine a smart number for X. Alternatively, or maybe more simply, HDB could allow rental contracts for these properties to match the length of the remaining lease, say up to 10 years, instead of the current 2-year maximum.This could address the need for cash for those with leases too short to re-sale effectively, while also expanding the rental housing supply.

t3_zmecjd,Sexual assault laws in Singapore,reddit,Legal,2022-12-15 06:36:00,-0.9981,"(TW: graphic descriptions of rape)I did already report my rape to the police last year a few days after it happened, but AGC has decided not to prosecute after a year-long investigation. In asking this, I would just like to know what band of punishment my rapist would’ve fallen under, given the factors. Any theoretical info from lawyers, law enforcement, or those who are familiar with the law would be very helpful. My experience was:- I (23F at the time) had agreed to meet this older man for sex. He was a listed dominant (and I was generally searching for a dom, as a sub). We did not specifically discuss or agree to CNC or BDSM, just that he would be more dominant and that I would be more submissive. - Boundaries on safe words (including stop, no, I’m in pain), and gestures (including crying and pushing away, rejecting something) were discussed and he agreed to all of it before we met. - We met, and I realised he had brought BDSM items. - He asked to use rope on me for a BJ at the very start and I agreed. - Proceeding to consensual anal sex, he started escalating to going very deep and rough behaviour. In a lot of pain, I tried pushing him against his hips to get off but he did not budge. I’m not sure if he noticed; maybe it’s why he didn’t stop. - I started crying from the extreme internal rectal pain. He stopped and asked me why I was crying. I told him he was hurting me, that I was in a lot of pain. He told me: “cry harder”, and continued to do even worse while holding my lower abdomen / hips down. It lasted around 20 minutes. I was wailing and sobbing loudly at this point, until i dissociated and basically went into an autopilot, silently compliant state until it was all over (I don’t know if legally it means I consented to all of it). - There was a point where I could probably have run out stark naked but I was afraid he would catch me and get more violent. - Subsequently there was slapping, hitting my body with his belt, twisting of my skin, and handcuffing. - When he tried to get me to ride him vaginally, I told him it hurt and got off. He proceeded to hogtie me with rope so I could not move, and penetrated me repeatedly. - Subsequently he put a collar and leash on me, and used it later on to twist and choke me (he also did it with his hands) while sodomising me again in a different position, still extremely painful internally, because I physically could not look over my shoulder to smile at him while crying and sobbing. - Continued to sodomise me while I was crying, wailing and shaking my head as he asked me “you like fat (his ethnicity) dick raping your ass?” and other questions about being a good little whore for him. - Throughout the 2 hours+ of this, I kept asking for him to stop or for breaks. He pretended he did not hear me until he was finally done with me and said “now you can have your break”.- 5 mins later proceeded with forced stimulation for a long while despite me telling him to stop.- Wanted to send me to all of his friends to use as a sex slave.- Took photos of me, unsure if he circulated them although police said he likely did not. Some included my blood on his dick and fingers.- I sustained vaginal and anal tears, sprained neck, redness + some mild bruising, and some short-term rectal issues including bleeding. All healed within 1–3 weeks. Only lasting injuries is developing PTSD. I can’t figure out if this was an aggravated rape / purposeful violence (in addition to the violence of rape itself) or not, given the little time it took me to heal from the mild physical injuries, and given the circumstances of arranging to meet him, consenting to the act of casual sex at the very beginning before it escalated, and having silently complied (without verbal consent) to everything else he wanted to do after it did escalate.Will always carry the guilt and self-blame for those grey areas, but that’s another story. Does anyone have any suggestions on how aggravated this rape may have been (if at all)? TIA. (Sorry if this offended anyone.)ETA: i am not asking this question with intentions to try and get my case prosecuted. i know there is a serious lack of evidence for this case and have accepted that my case won’t be tried, it is also now closed for good (unless of course he gets charges brought against him by another person, which would in turn revive this case). so am just asking out of curiosity trying to figure out how severe my assault was in the eyes of the law, E.g. if it’s considered aggravated assault, or a Band 1, 2 or 3 offence!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zmecjd/sexual_assault_laws_in_singapore/

He faced such bullshit as this while hunting for jobs online. Type 1: Bait & SwitchFirm XXXXXXXXXX offered my friend a job in a ""Training & HR"" role. He did a long ""quiz"" with me that i recognised as a standard FA personality quiz (Hint: Regardless, they'll take you). Short online interview that talked 40% HR 60% sales. One day after, called up my friend and informed him that the role was taken and kept asking if he would like to join sales and be a FA. The catch? This happened to my bud not once or twice, but 5 times. Major waste of time.The supposed job never existed, it's just a ""wanna do sales"". Type 2: Hidden ObjectiveSame as Type I, but instead, the position will be made up as if it's a marketing or PA role. Once you join, you're slated to become a FA.

t3_10m1jmr,On Raising NSF Pay.,reddit,Public Safety,2023-01-26 20:25:00,0.9798,"So, I made a comment a few weeks ago that was downvoted on r/NationalServiceSG \- because the premise basically was ‚ÄúAllowances don‚Äôt have to be raised just yet in light of the upcoming recession and financial situation‚Äù, something which I do still agree with to a certain extent. I had a sleepless night, woke up and went on a bit of a tangent to consider: \*how much would an increase in allowance actually cost?\* Let‚Äôs assume now that we are only adjusting Allowances to adjust to inflation rates, rather than dealing with the issue of how ethical being underpaid in allowances is.We must note here that for the sake of clarity that I‚Äôm not an Economist, Statist nor Political Analyst, and that many of these calculations are estimates. While my opinion will clearly be rather one-sided based on these numbers, I do think that the approach to these calculations can very clearly be flawed, and while I provide a little of my own opined commentary these are amateur observations and may not be as insightful as I wish. Lastly: opposing opinions are welcomed. While where I‚Äôll post this is likely to very much support these findings, there are very much valid places to nitpick or oppose the way I‚Äôve approached these statistics.**Inflation Rates, and (Proposed) Pay Rises:**Pay and allowance should always be allowed to match Inflation, to allow NSFs to afford the necessities and luxuries allowed to them ‚Äúin recognition of (their) contributions‚Äù (CMPB). A good estimate of a warranted increase in NSF pay would be to follow inflation rates, of which have been rather high by SG standards with the onset of the pandemic.Inflation Rates in 2021 and 2022 respectively were 2.3% and 6.7%, which isn‚Äôt really too bad considering COVID and the overall world financial situation. A rise of 7%, which I believe is a pretty realistic sentiment, would be a rise from \*SGD630\* to SGD674.10 for the lowest possible allowance allocated - to standardise everything, let‚Äôs just assume a $50 pay rise for all NSFs regardless of rank and vocation.**Number of NSFs and Total Cost:**Wikipedia notes that an average of 50,000 people serve NS annually - a number which isn‚Äôt really realistic, considering Resident Live Births per Singstat indicate 38,000-39,000 Singaporean Babies were born in 2001 and 2002 annually, falling to about \~35,000 p.a in 2003-2005. Halve these numbers for Males only, and being generous enough to round up, 18,500 Singaporean men at birth will enter NS annually. Add another 3,400 new citizens per year serving NS (Source: ST) and rounding up, we get 22,000 Singaporean men serving per year. Doubling that to highlight the total NSFs that would be in service this year, and throwing on some extras for good measure, *45,000 NSFs* would benefit from this pay rise as a super-rough ballpark estimate.Okay, basic maths would indicate that a rise in pay rates would be \~ 50 x 45,000 per month, which would be 2.25 mil per month higher spending, and *27 mil per year* additional financial pressure on the Military budget. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pretty expensive, but let‚Äôs take a look at comparative figures.**(A few) Comparative Figures:*** Janes‚Äô (A Military Journalism organization) notes that the SAF had an SGD 1 Billion rise in their budget from 2021 to 2022, to SGD 16.36 Billion, a 6.5% increase. This was attributed to, among other things, ‚Äúhigher construction requirements, including projects previously delayed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic‚Äù, and ‚Äúmodernisation plans laid out by the government in 2019‚Ä¶ delayed by Covid-19‚Äù. With some back of the envelope cost calculations (SEE COST BREAKDOWN HERE), the SAF spends a ballpark figure of around $455 Million per year on NSF pay. NSF pay thus makes up approximately 2.7-2.8% of the Singapore military budget. For comparison, the 27 mil increase would, well, comprise 2.7% of the $1Bil increase attributed to the SAF. Such an increase would thus be perfectly in line with the budgetary increases of the SAF.* In 2022, ‚Äúabout 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 (in 2022)‚Äù (source: ST), ‚Äúexceed(ing) Singapore‚Äôs core inflation rate of 5.1 per cent‚Äù (CNA). The main reasons for these pay rises were due to the competitive pay rises in the Private sector, while offsetting the rising cost of living due to inflation.* The GST hike, another reason for the increase in living costs, is likely to bring in an additional SGD 3.5 Billion p.a. by the full increase in 2024. A 27mil yearly increase for NSFs would make up approximately 0.77% of that annual budget increase.From an economic standpoint, I find it hard to justify not increasing NSF pay in light of budgetary and economic conditions. NSF allowances are small relative to the comparative private sector pay expectations - wage-driven inflation should not be a concerning factor given that wages have increased everywhere in Singapore. Even considering that NSF pay could be a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù, it can‚Äôt be overstated that with increases in living costs across the board - even in basic necessities such as transport and food - that this expected and thus essential source of income for NSFs should keep up with rising prices. If anything - should NSFs be paid only allowances due to our services being ‚Äúcrucial to the nation‚Äù, shouldn‚Äôt this minimal allowance be the first to increase, since it‚Äôs already the minimum expected to live on given our circumstances?If NSFs are to be at the forefront of the Nation‚Äôs defense, and expected to serve in light and despite of the challenges introduced by COVID and the economic and political turmoils over the past few years - they should be compensated at \*least\* to the same comparative standards as NSFs of years before. Even if NS ‚Äúcannot be measured by dollars and cents‚Äù - bus fares, Big Macs and Butter rolls all are, and the prices of those are burning holes in our pockets.

t3_1bcz2fj,Singapore steps up scrutiny of China wealth after money laundering case,reddit,Legal,2024-03-12 22:49:00,0.9469,"Original: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Singapore-steps-up-scrutiny-of-China-wealth-after-money-laundering-case](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Singapore-steps-up-scrutiny-of-China-wealth-after-money-laundering-case)  Non-paywall: [https://archive.ph/em733](https://archive.ph/em733)Singapore has stepped up scrutiny of Chinese wealth coming into the city, including rejecting applications to set up family offices, following a recent money laundering scandal.The Monetary Authority of Singapore since January has denied two family office applications with Chinese-affiliated wealth, according to two sources working on the cases. These include people who hold only a Chinese passport and those who hold additional foreign passports. The rejections were given in a written format but without a detailed explanation, as indicated by an email seen by Nikkei Asia.On the other hand, there has been at least one recent approval, from a non-Chinese national applicant, one of the people said.MAS does not publish a breakdown of applications or rejections.China nationals looking to set up family offices in the city-state are also facing closer questioning this year, the people said, with inquiries covering everything from how many passports the applicants hold to whether any entities connected to them are facing mainland regulatory action that could have implications for Singapore's anti-money laundering efforts, the people said.Single-family offices submit applications with MAS to qualify for tax breaks, but they can also choose to operate in the city-state without using those incentives. There were 1,400 single-family offices qualified for the incentives as of the end of 2023, a 27% jump from the end of 2022, latest official figures show. **The rejections come as Singapore continues to investigate the biggest money laundering case in its history. In August, police arrested 10 individuals of nationalities from China, Turkey, Cambodia, Cyprus, Vanuatu, Dominica, and St. Kitts and Navis in connection with the case. Authorities have seized or frozen assets worth over 3 billion Singapore dollars ($2.3 billion).** Inquiries to set up family offices in Singapore slowed in the months following the money laundering investigations, lawyers and wealth advisers [told Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Singapore-family-office-inquiries-slow-amid-money-laundering-probe) in late October.In a statement to Nikkei Asia, MAS said there were rejections in the past, even before the money laundering scandal, though it did not provide figures or a breakdown of applications by nationality. ""All applications for tax incentives from Single Family Offices (SFOs) are assessed against a set of criteria, which include assets under management, number of investment professionals hired and an assessment of money laundering risks,"" an MAS spokesperson said. ""The set of criteria applies to all applicants, regardless of nationality. Applicants that had failed to meet \[MAS's\] criteria were rejected. This has always been the case. There have been rejections before the money laundering investigation in August,"" the statement continued. ""MAS continues to receive a steady stream of applications for tax incentives from SFOs."" According to an email sent recently by MAS to a Singapore family office entity and seen by Nikkei, the entity's name and ""a letter of rejection"" were highlighted following a brief statement from the MAS. ""We have considered \[entity name\]'s application made under the 13O to use tax incentives, but we regret to inform you that the application is not yet successful,"" according to the email. Nikkei Asia was asked not to name the entity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The Singapore entity, which had sought to utilize a tax incentive program for family offices known as the 13O, is now considering diversifying from Singapore to Canada after the failed attempt, one of the people said. To qualify for 13O incentives, family offices must put at least SG$20 million of assets in funds and invest SG$200,000 in local businesses, as well as employ at least two professionals. Wealthy individuals are allowed to put money into private banks in Singapore without using the family office scheme. A person familiar with the matter said MAS did not usually reject applications outright in the past. ""They just let you wait for very long, and the wait has been longer and longer, \[from\] 12 months \[to\] 18 months and 24 months. From the start of this year, we start to see some outright rejections."" A rejection means the MAS will not consider the application again, the person added. A second source said MAS is posing more questions to private banks and family offices about their know-your-client processes in relation to money laundering. There are still applications in the pipeline, ""but the process has been extremely slow,"" the person added. **""With an upcoming election, the priority of Singapore is not to take in more family offices but to address the wealth gap following a huge inflow of money that pushed up real estate prices,"" a private banker said. Garnering a high level of support is crucial for the long-ruling People's Action Party, he said.** Singapore is set to hold a general election by November 2025, while Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is set to pass the baton to a new leader, Lawrence Wong, this year. **Alvin Tan, Minister of State for Trade and Industry and a board member of the MAS, said in May that ""family offices themselves have had virtually no impact on our private housing market, as there was no residential property transaction attributable to family offices over the last six years."" Tan was addressing the parliament's questions on family offices.**All sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Many are still hopeful that Chinese wealth will keep coming to the city following the need to diversify from their home country. Han Shen Lin, a finance professor at New York University Shanghai, said such rejections reflect a tightening of Singapore's anti-money laundering standards after the recent scandal. ""Yet Chinese will continue to transfer their wealth to Singapore as they look to diversify their assets away from a riskier onshore environment,"" he said. ""The U.S. and Europe are increasingly unwelcoming of Chinese money, thus leaving Singapore as the most attractive hub,"" Lin added. ""The rejections signal that China family offices should expect more hurdles going forward."" *Additional reporting by Dylan Loh in Singapore*",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bcz2fj/singapore_steps_up_scrutiny_of_china_wealth_after/

t3_1edjp0m,"Low respect, limited prospects drive S'pore veterinarians to places like UK, Australia",reddit,Employment,2024-07-28 00:00:00,0.9972,"SINGAPORE — After diagnosing a dog with diabetes, Dr Cathy Chan, a general practice veterinarian, was met with blame from the pet’s owners. The clients alleged that the results of their tests were due to the stress caused by the veterinary examination itself.“They argued that our procedures and the stress of the visit were responsible for the diagnosis,” the 45-year-old told TODAY. Dr Chan, co-founder of The Animal Doctors, said that this was a confronting yet common situation not just at her veterinary clinic but also among other veterinarians she knows. “Vets are often blamed for the pet’s disease, especially when the diagnosis is unexpected, or the disease requires long-term management,” she added. In that specific case, the pet owners eventually agreed to diabetes treatment for the dog after multiple phone calls and consultations.Dr Chan, who had worked in Australia for two-and-a-half years before opening her clinic in Singapore, said that the lack of trust shown by clients here makes the job more challenging than it is overseas.Clients in some other countries tend to trust veterinary professionals more, leading to a more cooperative and effective treatment process, she added.Clients' scepticism and mistrust are among several factors prompting Singaporean vets to pursue their careers in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom, where the veterinary field is regarded as more established and respected.Singaporean vets, from general practitioners to specialists, often move overseas to practise due to better work-life balance, higher client respect and veterinary industries with comprehensive facilities and specialisation, based on what 11 veterinarians told TODAY.There are also more opportunities overseas for internships and residencies, along with supportive work environments, that also make it easier for vets to advance their careers and further their education.The National Parks Board said that there are about 590 licensed veterinarians in Singapore as of this May, an increase from 542 last year.This could be due to a higher demand for veterinary services over the years, it added.The number of licensed dogs has also gone up by about 29 per cent over the last five years, it said.There are now about 90,000 licensed dogs in Singapore.Pet imports into Singapore have risen significantly, with a more than 30 per cent increase over the past five years, likely driven by a growing demand for pets and increased pet relocation as more people move with their animals.Dogs and cats make up the majority of imported pets, but other animals, including hamsters, rabbits, birds and guinea pigs, are also commonly brought into the country.Dr Teo Boon Han, Singapore Veterinary Association's president, told TODAY that the number of licensed veterinarians here has risen, but this statistic does not fully capture the complexities affecting the availability of the services they provide.Factors such as veterinarians shifting to part-time work, taking breaks from the industry or moving abroad are not reflected.""Vets move abroad because the veterinary ecosystem is more mature in other countries such as Australia, the UK and the United States, where there are universities that offer internships and residency programmes."" Dr Teo described the situation as a vicious circle. As manpower becomes increasingly limited, the workload for the remaining veterinary personnel does not drop.""To cover for this, the vets and vet nurses still in the industry would need to work longer hours, leading to more [burnout](https://www.todayonline.com/topic/burnout) and compassion fatigue, which would lead to more people leaving the industry.""Echoing Dr Chan's sentiments, Dr Vanessa Lian, an emergency veterinarian at the Animal Emergency Centre in Brisbane, Australia, said she felt that Australian clients generally show more respect for veterinarians than those in Singapore.     “Australians are also more open to running tests for accurate diagnoses and are understanding if we explain things clearly,” the Singaporean told TODAY.This presented a stark contrast to some clients in Singapore. Dr Lian could relate to Dr Chan’s story of the diabetes diagnosis, because the anecdote sounded similar to the experiences she had heard from her veterinarian friends working in Singapore. It also lined up with what she had observed as a nurse and receptionist at a vet clinic in Marine Parade before she moved to Australia to get her degree in veterinary medicine. This stark difference made Singapore seem like a daunting place to begin her career as a fresh graduate. After hearing of these experiences, Dr Lian said: “It makes me not want to come back.” Likewise, Dr Jayson Tuan, who spent 12 years working in Australia and the UK before returning to Singapore in 2021, finds clients to be generally more appreciative and respectful in the UK than here. Given that he was in general practice in Australia and never did that in Singapore, he was unable to make a direct comparison. ""It is possible that the public in the UK is much more aware of the difficulty in getting into vet school and the sacrifice required to complete the course. It is well-known that the vet course is highly competitive and hard to get into,"" the 41-year-old said. Dr Rina Maguire, who returned to Singapore in 2015 after six years working in the US, said that the ease of searching for information online could lead clients to question their vet’s advice.To tackle this, Dr Maguire from Beecroft Animal Specialist and Emergency Hospital in Bukit Merah found that taking an evidence-based approach to medicine and ensuring strong communication with clients are effective methods.She is an exotics specialist who treats unusual pets such as reptiles.“If clients are still indecisive after extensive counselling, referring them to a specialist can provide the authoritative guidance needed,” she added.Currently, Singapore does not have veterinary medicine courses for students who wish to become veterinarians.Diploma courses in veterinary bioscience and veterinary technology are available at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic, but these are not enough, because being a full-fledged veterinarian requires a recognised veterinary degree. Due to this, people seeking to become general practitioners or board-certified specialists in veterinary medicine generally need to train and obtain certification abroad.CNA news channel reported in January that many veterinary students are looking to work overseas after graduating, because they will be able to specialise in areas not commonly offered in Singapore.Dr Siak Meng Keet, 43, a veterinary dermatologist in Perth, Australia, said that his decision to pursue specialisation required him to work in a country with a robust training programme. “When I graduated, there were zero specialists in Singapore in any field (of veterinary medicine).""While the veterinary care in Singapore was good, the industry wasn’t as established or experienced as in countries like Australia.” Dr Siak added that advanced diagnostics such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were not common in his field here then, limiting vets' ability to provide the best care for animals.He now has a family in Australia and has considered moving back here to be closer to his parents and friends. However, he has chosen to remain in Perth, where career opportunities are stabler.  “I started my own clinic six years ago and it has been very busy. Moving back to Singapore would require re-establishing the business.” Dr Aria Sim of Hillside Veterinary Surgery in Upper Serangoon said that beyond dogs, cats and small animals, Singapore's limited vet industry restricts growth opportunities for vets with particular interests. ""We don't have farms or stables, making it hard for new graduates to gain a foothold in large-animal work or non-clinical roles.""The 30-year-old also said that the vets' role here are ""primarily"" being the first point of contact for a pet owner and then doing ""referral work"", so opportunities and awareness of other roles are scarce in Singapore.After graduating, Dr Sim worked for two years in Surrey, England, before moving back here early last year. On work-life balance, many vets agreed that the hours were generally better overseas.Dr Teo Ee Fung, 37, an emergency and critical care veterinarian at Waves Hospital in Perth, feels that she enjoys a better balance at her workplace now after spending several years in general practice and emergency in Singapore. “When I used to work in Singapore, the hours were extremely long and a typical work day may be 12 hours.""If we were scheduled for the emergency shift, that day would end up being a 24-hour work day. It was usually hectic through the shift.""In Perth, there is more space and time to breathe between shifts and it does not feel like life is all about work.” Dr Charlotte Sim, 32, a general practitioner at Swan Veterinary Hospital in Perth, said that most clinics in Western Australia are efficient at scheduling the day. “If the clinic closes at 6pm, the last consultation is at 5.30pm, which allows us time to finish our history-recording for patients and leave work on time.” Dr Siak, the veterinary dermatologist, said that this efficient scheduling was possible due to Australia's culture of prioritising time off and family time, as well as the “luxury” of having many emergency hospitals, which reduces the workload of dealing with after-hours clients. Dr Jolyn Lai, 31, a senior veterinary surgeon, finds it difficult for a young adult to break into Singapore's property market without financial support, unlike in Australia, where she enjoys a higher quality of life and more outdoor activities. ""I could enter the property market at a much younger age in Australia, with limited finances, without waiting until the age of 35 or balloting for a [BTO (Built-to-Order)](https://www.todayonline.com/topic/bto) flat.""Singapore residents have to be 35 and older to buy a public housing unit on their own.[https://www.todayonline.com/features/makes-me-not-want-come-back-low-respect-limited-prospects-drive-spore-vets-places-uk-australia-2465101?fbclid=IwY2xjawER98VleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHfqO76ZFS5RSWx3eti8uEro0qtcqvwDZeayVFZC\_YOqTTy6WXN3aelDoQw\_aem\_lKAtiXvALNZrPMLv2qc7cA](https://www.todayonline.com/features/makes-me-not-want-come-back-low-respect-limited-prospects-drive-spore-vets-places-uk-australia-2465101?fbclid=IwY2xjawER98VleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHfqO76ZFS5RSWx3eti8uEro0qtcqvwDZeayVFZC_YOqTTy6WXN3aelDoQw_aem_lKAtiXvALNZrPMLv2qc7cA)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1edjp0m/low_respect_limited_prospects_drive_spore/

t3_1g7yv3h,Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System,reddit,Housing,2024-10-20 21:36:00,0.9578,"In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones. This approach is creating significant issues, particularly when people have their eyes on a specific project but are forced to consider other projects within the same estate. For example, the recent BTO launch includes 3 bundled Bedok projects (2 Bayshore sites and 1 Kembangan site) and 3 bundled Kallang/Whampoa sites (1 Lavender site, 1 Whampoa site, 1 Upper Boon Keng site). Applicants do not have the option to ballot for a single site; they must enter the ballot for all sites in the same bundle.# 1. ""Forced to Choose"" to avoid New Penalty RulesOne of the primary issues is that applicants aiming for a specific project are automatically entered into a ballot for every project in the estate. If they fail to get a favorable queue number for their desired project, they may be forced to choose from other projects that they may have no real interest in. Otherwise, they’ll have to face a one-year wait-out penalty where they are barred from balloting again.This creates an undesirable situation where applicants must either settle for a less appealing project just to avoid the penalty, or be locked out of the system for a year. It’s not just about getting lucky — in the current state, even ""average luck"" won’t suffice if applicants are aiming for highly sought-after projects. Let's look at the current BTO exercise as an example: those who are interested in Crawford Heights (prime location with only 234 4R units) are currently competing with 1,880 other applicants, meaning only about the top 15% will secure a unit at Crawford Heights, while the rest must choose between the other two projects (Towner Breeze and Kallang View) or face the one-year penalty. Now this used to be less of an issue in previous exercises where projects were bundled together as an estate. For example October 2023's Kallang/Whampoa BTO launch also had 3 different sites bundled together, and while one is a PLH, the other two are standard flats with 5 year MOP. If applicants were not able to select their desired PLH flat, they could still choose either of the standard flats and only serve a 5-year MOP. This provided applicants with a valuable safety net: if they could not secure their preferred PLH flat, they still had the option to select one of the standard flats and only commit to a 5-year MOP, allowing for greater flexibility in their housing decisions. Not to mention, these standard flats came with no restrictions, were still situated in prime areas, and held significant potential profit after just 5 years. Unfortunately, all Kallang/Whampoa projects in the current exercise are at least Plus flats, and have a 10 year MOP. This means that applicants could potentially be locked into a longer commitment in a home they might not genuinely want. Whether due to job relocations, changes in family size, or shifts in personal preferences, being tied to a property for such an extended period can severely limit options.**2. Pitfalls of Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)**The MCPS is designed to encourage applicants to live near their parents by granting them an extra ballot chance for projects located close to their parents' homes. However, in large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, the geographic spread of available projects can be quite vast. This creates a situation where people aiming for a specific project near their parents may find themselves instead needing to consider another project that is far from them.Moreover, applicants can apply for this scheme as long as at least one of the units bundled together is near their parents, thereby birthing a potential loophole in this scheme whereby applicants can use their proximity advantage to gain a better chance for a project that is not actually near their parents. For instance, someone who qualifies for the scheme because their parents live near Project A could use that extra ballot chance to select a unit in Project B, even if Project B is far from their parents (assuming both Project A and B are lumped into the same estate). This undermines the original purpose of the scheme, which is meant to facilitate closer family living, not provide an unfair advantage for unrelated projects.**3. Neglecting Locational Differences and Individual Needs**    Lumping multiple projects into a single estate-wide ballot fails to account for both the geographical spread and applicants' individual preferences. In large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, projects can be located far apart, making it unfair to treat them as one choice. Applicants aiming for a specific location may end up balloting for projects that are not as conveniently located. This approach also disregards varied personal priorities—whether it's proximity to work, family, or access to amenities—reducing the process to simply securing a unit, rather than finding a home that meets their specific needs.  In light of these issues, one must wonder why HDB continue to implement this bundled ballot system. While the intention may be to streamline the application process and increase efficiency, it raises serious concerns about fairness and the ability of Singaporeans to secure homes that genuinely meet their needs. As the housing landscape evolves, it is essential for HDB to consider these implications and adapt its approach to better serve the diverse needs of its BTO applicants.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7yv3h/exposing_a_huge_flaw_in_the_current_bto_balloting/

Is it accurate to say that these are just gov printing money but in a different way since there are negative connotations when people think about gov printing money leading to increase in money supply in an economy?If yes, then this is not sustainable. Our CDC vouchers will certainly run out before the year ends, but the hike in prices due to extra demand as a result of CDC will obviously be here to stay. Then when people need to purchase goods and services with their own money, that’s when they feel the pinch. Also, people are now going to expect CDC every year.

t3_1grsbi7,"A boy left home to play football, but never returned home. What happened to Wong Weng Boon?",reddit,Public Safety,2024-11-15 17:02:00,0.9953,"Another week, another File! Some may know about the Mcdonalds' Boys, but not many may know about this almost-similar case that occurred a few years before the boys' disappearance.**A Background of Wong Weng Boon**The third child in his family, 12 year old Wong Weng Boon was a student at Rangoon Road Primary School (the school would be closed later in 1983 and its premises are currently home to the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society) and was due to take his PSLE. Those that knew him described him as a polite and studious boy who loved to play football, and one of his siblings described him as a caring brother with an interest in collecting stamps.He would go to school with his elder brother Watson, who happened to notice that he had obtained a bicycle. However, he did not put much further thought into it other than noting that the friend was rather generous. This was not unusual, as they did not know much about their other siblings' friends.On 14 November 1975, the last day of school after PSLE, Weng Boon left home, saying he was going to school to play football with his friends. He was in his school uniform, and had taken his football and around $1 with him. His schoolmates would report seeing him leave school that day, and a family friend had reportedly seen him at the Bugis Street area accompanied by 2 men. When he attempted to approach Weng Boon, he was told by the two men to mind his own business.When Weng Boon failed to return home, his mother, Mdm Chan Yeok Lin, started to worry. Going through his phone book, she started to call up his friends to check if they knew where he was, however none of them knew where he was.The next day, after Weng Boon failed to turn up, the family contacted the police to report Weng Boon as missing.**The Search**Weng Boon's family went all around Singapore hoping to find him. Mdm Chan would go on the search for at least 3 years, carrying with her a copy of Weng Boon's photo. She would follow up with every lead, no matter how small they were. At one time, she had even staked out a flat at Bendemeer for 3 days after there was a sighting of him, however it would prove fruitless.Mdm Chan would go down to Rangoon Road Primary School on PSLE results release day, in hopes that Weng Boon would show up to take his PSLE results. However, he never turned up to enjoy the fruits of his hard work.As human efforts turned up nothing, desperation led Mdm Chan to turn to the spiritual help of temples and bomohs to look for answers. Their answers were rather consistent in that he was still alive and somewhere in Singapore. Additionally, they had also said that someday he would return home.The family would also place a newspaper advertisement appealing for information on 4 December 1975, around 2 weeks after his disappearance, in hopes that anyone with information would come forward.**A Ruse in Aljunied**Around a year and a half after the appeal was published, a man called up claiming to have information on where Weng Boon was. Upon meeting Mdm Chan, he brought her to a flat in Aljunied and pointed out a unit, claiming that he was there and demanded money from Mdm Chan. She handed over $100 to the man, who then told her to call out for 'Johnny', as he claimed that Weng Boon was now there under that name.Unfortunately, this was all a hoax, as Weng Boon was nowhere to be found when Mdm Chan entered the flat. The man had gotten away and was not apprehended.**Ran or Lured Away?**Initially, it was feared that Weng Boon had run away, however it remained questionable at best given that he had only had his football and $1 with him. Given the lack of items taken with him, the theory soon shifted to that of being lured away. Private Investigator Henry Tay would add the following:>*""Who did he went out to play with? Nobody knew. He also does not let his family know who are most of his friends. He hangs around in the old, New World entertainment area\* and those are places where you'll find a lot of bad hats in those days. And also, he tends to ride bicycles home, which the family don't even know where he got it from. So, who he associates with, I'm sure the family does not really know.""*\* - this is likely a reference to the New World Amusement Park, which was located where City Square Mall and City Square Residences are presently located.A friend who had seen him on the day, he was seen riding a bicycle around the school grounds. When asked, he simply said that a friend had lent him the bicycle. Besides the bicycle, this friend had also given him a pair of roller skates.Weng Boon's mother believed that he may even have been abducted, in a time when he could have been looking for a job. The theory did seem plausible after the family friend's sighting, however with the family friend not being able to take Weng Boon back or trace the whereabouts of the men he was seen with, it was now difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain whether this was the case.**A Mcdonalds' Connection?**The case would resurface back to the public eye after Watson read about the missing Mcdonalds' Boys (Toh Hong Huat and Keh Chin Ann) who went missing in 1986 and decided to call up the local news, highlighting that there were some striking similarities between both Both Weng Boon and the Mcdonalds' Boys case. They were around the same age, and had disappeared after heading for school. Furthermore, their schools were also reasonably close to one another, as the Mcdonalds' Boys attended Owen Primary School, which was not only along the same street as Rangoon Road Primary School, but was just across it.With the similarities, it seemed possible that Weng Boon could also have faced a similar ending as the Mcdonalds' Boys, being sold off to a syndicate to beg overseas. Mdm Chan would share with the media the following, which she had told to others:>*""I asked friends and relatives to look out for anyone resembling him begging on the streets here and in the region""*There were reportedly some sightings of a person fitting Weng Boon's description emerging in Indonesia and Thailand, however when further efforts were made to check on these claims, nothing was found.Unfortunately, despite Watson's fresh appeal for information, there was no new information or leads that would emerge.**The Trail Goes Cold**Eventually, after years of searching, the family would have to come to terms that their son would never be seen again, and their lives had to move on. The family would subsequently move to Jurong after their shophouse was scheduled for demolition, and Watson & Audrene (Weng Boon's sister) would go on pursue their careers.Most of Weng Boon's belongings were thrown away, but Mdm Chan had retained his photos and stamp books, to serve as a reminder of her missing son.**Questions**What do you think happened to Weng Boon?Could there be a link between the Mcdonalds' Boys and Weng Boon's disappearance?**Sources**New Nation (4 Dec 1975) - [Missing from home...](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/newnation19751204-1.2.9.2)The New Paper (30 Apr 1994) - [Mum wouldn't recognise him, Showed photo of son to people around Singapore](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19940430-1.1.8), [Cheated by man with 'I have news' ruse, We still miss our brother](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/newpaper19940430-1.1.11)The New Paper (1 Aug 1994) - [Still no clue after 19 years](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/newpaper19940801-1.2.16.3)[Missing - Where is Weng Boon?](https://www.mewatch.sg/watch/Missing-S2-E3-Where-Is-Weng-Boon-57097) \- (DISCLAIMER - I do not advise watching at night)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1grsbi7/a_boy_left_home_to_play_football_but_never/

You don’t have the same investor protections and recourse if something goes wrong. You can’t scrutinize an investment on its own merits because you don’t have a clear picture of the company and the industry’s finances. Everything is opaque and unregulated. So so reckless.To put it bluntly, Temasek is investing **public money** in a sector rife with scams and little to none investor protection. It invested blindly and recklessly when it should have been more prudent with public money. This is **not** the same as investing in high risk startups in other industries nor is it the same as a private fund investing in crypto when the fund's investors already know what they are getting into.‘ The problem with #crypto, as in most things, is the leverage. If you don't know how much leverage is in crypto, you don't know anything about crypto, no matter how much else you think you know.’    -   Michael Burry, Jun 2021",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/yq7fxv/temasek_was_a_lead_investor_in_ftx_now_insolvent/

t3_1f7bfbm,My rejected forum letter to the Straits Times: Singapore's Car-lite ambitions all bark but little bite,reddit,Transport,2024-09-03 00:44:00,0.9628,"I'll post it here as an open letter instead, since ST doesn't want to publish this. Too critical? Too little bootlicking? I'll let you decide.---As an urban planning enthusiast, I have been following with keen interest Singapore's car-lite plans in recent years. I was heartened to read about developments such as car-lite towns (e.g. Tengah), or [the planned expansion of Singapore's cycling path network to 1,300km by 2030](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2020/3/news-releases/islandwide-cycling-network--icn--programme-to-improve-safety-and.html), yet ultimately disappointed at their implementations. It seems that despite the many proclamations of going car-lite, Singapore is only taking half-hearted measures of limited effectiveness.To be clear, going car-lite is not a novel ambition for a city to pursue. Cities all around the world have taken massive steps towards reducing their reliance on cars. For instance, [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/953-23/mayor-adams-celebrates-first-phase-10th-avenue-upgrade-extra-wide-protected-bike-lane) has converted car lanes in many of its arterial downtown avenues into protected bike and bus lanes. [Paris](https://www.distilled.earth/p/how-paris-is-taking-back-its-streets) closed down major roads, converting them to bike highways, and removed >70% of parking spaces to accommodate cyclists - both growing cycling traffic and reducing car ownership significantly. San Francisco, Oslo, Copenhagen, and many more other cities are taking similar steps to reduce car usage and promote walking, cycling, and public transit.In all these case studies, a common theme is redesigning physical infrastructure to be less car centric.Yet, in Singapore, this aspect has been neglected. Singapore's physical infrastructure remains steadfastly car-centric. Most of the new bike lanes I see are not reclaiming space from cars, but from pedestrians. What used to be a wider pavement has been split down the middle, to be shared by both pedestrians and cyclists. Meanwhile, the wide roads for cars remain untouched. This is true even in supposedly car-lite Tengah.The most glaring example of unjustifiable car-centric design is in Singapore's downtown CBD - Singapore's most walkable, transit-dense, and connected region. In the area with arguably the least need to drive, [Robinson Road](https://www.google.com/maps/@1.279696,103.8493815,3a,75y,223.57h,84.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGwNkqTJKqnHTqeQRVFz9KQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205409&entry=ttu) features 5 wide lanes for vehicles but narrow pavements for humans to share. Singapore's CBD bike lane network consists of painted lines on pavements, while the wide, 5-6 lanes of road space are seemingly and inexplicably protected and untouchable.It is hardly surprising then that car owners are reluctant to give up driving, because Singapore's infrastructure and policies continually reinforce the car as the superior mode of transportation. All the painted bike lanes and reclaimed pavements will hardly make a dent in changing travel patterns, as long as the car remains at the top of the hierarchy.True car-lite cities in the world do not need COEs to forcibly cap car ownership rates. Instead, car-liteness is achieved when policies and infrastructure prioritize non-car modes of travel such that people naturally opt out of driving. In Singapore, it seems the authorities want to have their cake and eat it too - by preserving the status quo of the car as king of the road, yet trying to convince the population to leave their keys at home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1f7bfbm/my_rejected_forum_letter_to_the_straits_times/

Why was the introduction of a middleman (GSA Pte Ltd) necessary?,reddit,Education,2024-08-05 19:13:00,0.8541,"Mobile Guardian, it was apparent from the start, was a two-bit operation that implemented its product in a hideously amateurish way. The data breach a while back should have been a wake-up call, but it was not heeded.At the point the contract was awarded, larger, more established solutions serving educational institutions, providing essentially the same services, were available - namely, Jamf School and Mosyle. These companies had a large number of school districts in the US as customers, and would have been capable of providing better-tested, better-proven services to MOE.To date, MOE is probably Mobile Guardian's largest customer by far. We make 2 observations: Most of the recent reviews for the Mobile Guardian app seem to originate from Singapore-based users, and most of the company's clients appear to be single schools scattered around the world. To this extent, the MOE contract is a gold mine for the company.Millions of dollars of public money were spent on this fiasco. Singaporeans deserve to have this sum accounted for. We owe it to the students who lost their notes weeks before life-changing national exams.The CPIB, in particular, needs to ask a few questions, to satisfy itself that everything done was above-board. Let me give some suggestions as to the questions they ought to ask:1. Why was Mobile Guardian, a minor player with an unproven product (at least, at the scale MOE deployed it), chosen to provide the MDM solution for public schools in Singapore?2. Was it necessary for a middleman (i.e. GSA Pte Ltd) to be involved in the transaction? How much did GSA pay Mobile Guardian for the performance of the contract - that is, what profit did GSA derive from the transaction? What work did GSA do to deserve this profit? Why are there rumblings that a new PAP candidate in the upcoming election is involved in GSA Pte Ltd?3. Was a more established MDM solution not chosen because the need for a middleman (i.e. GSA Pte Ltd) would have been eliminated? Was the choice of Mobile Guardian itself intended to justify what is in effect a gift of taxpayer funds to a company (GSA) closely linked to the ruling party?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ekl53n/why_was_mobile_guardian_chosen_by_moe_as_the_mdm/

I realise that having children is often treated like another checklist item - get married, buy house, have kids etc. But bringing a human life into this world is such a huge responsibility. This new life will have to face challenges, ups and downs, heartache etc. So it is not something that should be dictated by public policy, GDP per capita, or supporting aging population. It should be guided by an immense sense of responsibility, maturity and commitment. Some ppl have kids because ""thats what they are supposed to do"" (their words) - i find this kinda thinking so irresponsible.  There are so many problems today (climate change, pollution, food security, income inequality) that are the result of growing populations taxing finite natural resources. As such how can I bring a life into this world which I know will be headed towards really hard times? Maybe it is high time society recognises this and re-writes the narrative about having kids. It should not rest on economics OR a life checklist. You cant just role out policies and say ""have kids"" - it doesnt work that way. We should rethink a future where there is a smaller population and it still continues to be economically viable - this would solve soo soo many problems in terms of housing, infrastructure, transport, immigration, jobs, and on a global level climate change, food security etc. But instead of thinking objectively about having children, ppl muddle it with religion, economics, tradition .... is it just me who feels that having kids is being taken for granted?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/y6868u/is_singapore_taking_the_right_approach_towards/

The goal is to keep the EWT within a certain threshold, typically a few minutes, to ensure that passengers do not face excessive waiting times. It allows for slight variations in bus arrival times, as long as the average wait time remains within the set threshold. This improves the consistency of bus frequencies by reducing the likelihood of long waits between buses.* **On-Time Adherence (OTA):** OTA focuses on ensuring that buses adhere closely to the scheduled arrival and departure times by measuring the percentage of buses that arrive and depart within a specific time window around the scheduled time. The goal is to achieve a high percentage of on-time departures and arrivals, often set at 80% or higher. Thus, it requires buses to closely adhere to the scheduled timetable, minimising variations in arrival and departure times. It aims to provide a more predictable and reliable service for passengers, allowing them to plan their journeys based on the published timetable.Since the start of the [Bus Contracting Model (BCM)](https://landtransportguru.net/bus-infrastructure/bus-contracting-model/) in 2016, **all** basic bus services are required to operate under either EWT or OTA indicators. As of this post, **most** basic bus services operate under the EWT indicator, while a minority of 77 ""low frequency"" bus services operate under OTA, based on a Facebook post by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng in 2019 (Link to the post cannot be shared here due to Reddit restrictions). The quantity of OTA services has changed since then, with the discontinuation of multiple OTA services in 2020 (post-COVID), and the launch of new OTA services (most of which being route variants).1 major downside of bus services under OTA is their potentially longer travelling time, as bus drivers are required to adhere to strict schedules, which means driving slower or laying over at bus stops when they reach too early.Here is the updated list of services running under OTA as of Apr 2023. OTA services can be easily identified by their timetables at their calling bus stops. For SBS Transit and Tower Transit OTA services, their timetables can also be found on their service guides, as well as the SBS Transit app (for SBST services only). **All Express (services starting with 5xx, with suffix ""e"" and ""E"") and City Direct bus services (services starting with 6xx) currently run under OTA. Thus, they'll be excluded from the list below.*** **Operates on OTA daily (including public holidays):** 11, 40, 42, 98M, 115, 127/127A, 143M, 160, 160M, 170, 175, 177, 191, 400, 401, 403, 912\*, 927, 950, 970, 972M, 976, 981* **Operates on OTA on Saturdays only:** 90A, 92/92B, 162/162M, 980* **Operates on OTA on Sundays & Public Holidays only:** 78, 96, 173, 183, 883M, 966* **Operates on OTA on Saturdays, Sundays & Public Holidays only:** 54, 57, 79, 90, 93, 97, 122, 123, 125, 136, 155, 156, 158, 186, 200/200A\*Service 912 (in this instance) refers to the **intra-town** trips that operate on both East loop (towards Admiralty MRT) and West loop (towards Woodlands Train Checkpoint) only. The single loop trips (912A & 912B) currently operate on EWT.With the above background info on BSRF and the EWT/OTA indicators, here are some questions for fellow redditors who frequent public bus services in Singapore (and overseas):1. **Effectiveness:** Did you notice improvements in bus punctuality since the introduction of OTA on selected services? Are buses generally arriving on time as per the schedules?2. **Flexibility vs. Precision:** Do you appreciate the strict adherence to schedules with OTA, or do you feel it limits flexibility for passengers with longer travelling time on buses? Did you encounter situations where buses have left early or missed connections due to strict adherence to the schedule?3. **Efficiency:** In your opinion, has OTA resulted in better utilisation of bus resources and improved service efficiency? Or do you feel there are instances of inefficient operations, such as empty or overcrowded buses?4. **Expansion of OTA to Existing EWT Services:** Given your experience with OTA services (if any), should OTA be extended to more trunk services (i.e. services with frequencies longer than 15 mins, instead of the current standard of 20 mins).5. **Comparison with Overseas Implementation:** For redditors living/who have lived overseas and taken their bus services, are there similar bus reliability indicators implemented by their bus operators/authorities? Are they more effective than the EWT/OTA indicators by LTA, and should Singapore take a page out of overseas bus operators when implementating such indicators?While the above questions mainly focus on OTA, those who have thoughts on the effectiveness of EWT in improving bus service reliability can also share them below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13y7e22/has_ota_been_effective_in_improving_bus_service/

t3_126sb0h,Polyclinic shortage of appointment slots is just ridiculous nowadays....,reddit,Healthcare,2023-03-30 16:40:00,-0.9376,"I remember about a decade ago, I got sick at work and could still walk in to see a polyclinic doctor in the afternoon, no appointment needed. This wasnt a one off occurence either, there were several times i had to see a doctor in the afternoon and were able to walk in and see one. Makes sense right?Now, you have to book the night before, so that means if you are sick on the day itself, **you have no chance of seeing a polyclinic doctor**.Case in point : I just tried to book an appointment for National University Polyclinics...all slots are already taken. If someone wakes up in the morning, is sick, and needs to see a doctor...they have no chance of getting a slot. GG.In the past, they also had some slots reserved for emergency walk in cases on the day itself. Now, there is no such thing (they explictly told me there is no such thing), everything has to be booked before hand, and all slots are taken up the night before.How have things gotten so bad? I cant afford to get my meds from a private GP because there is no subsidy (CHAS doesnt cover the cost of medications and CHAS orange only covers $10 out of a typical $50+ consultation fee). It just seems ridiculous to me that there are no time slots reserved for sick people on the day itself...how can anyone predict ""yea, im going to be sick tommorrow, better book a slot now""?

t3_t8dtj9,Tracetogether revisited,reddit,Public Health,2022-03-07 01:32:00,-0.8946,"Wanted to give some thoughts after reading this article: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-tracetogether-safeentry-moh-parliament-safe-management-measures-2534451)Unpacking some of the points in this article:\- "" Measures for contact tracing, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, will continue until Singapore authorities "" - 1) Is contact tracing still done and possible?. At the number of cases today its is highly unlikely that contact tracing is possible or even relevant. 2) many people do not report their ART positive status officially undermining contact tracing to be even possible; lets say for discussion sake that only half the people reports their Covid status, that means we have about 40k cases per day. Let say that each of them had contact with 20 people during their contagious phase. This would imply 800k people per day would be subject to ""contract tracing"" or about 14% of the population per day!; and 3) As per the same government rules one just need to sit it out at home when testing positive and can come out after 7 days in any case. **The rules literally imply no contact tracing to be required,** unless you wish to get you result registered, which is likely driven by the asymmetric advantages that you get for travel or to avoid a future booster.: ""If you are ART positive: 🏠 Recover from home. ➡️ No need to see a GP/polyclinic, if well/have mild symptoms. ➡️ To register your results with MOH, visit a test centre ""\-  ""We need to wait until we no longer need vaccine-differentiated measures"" - 1) what about MRTs, buses, they are not vaccine-differentiated, people just hop on and off. And keeping 1 meter distance in MRTs of buses is impossible. - so lets agree that the country is not really in a in a complete vaccine-differentiated state; 2) how many people are really non-vaccinated, there are around 2-4% of 60+ people non vaccinated. (source: [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/statistics](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/statistics)) Shall we let an entire country get organised around these few that had 1.5+ year to get vaccinated and at this point are either completely complacent and irrelevant in a democratic thinking or might have underlying complications that refrain them from vaccination which would be a status quo in any other scenarios anyways. 3) kids under 12y are not getting sick. Only 0.013% of cases under 12y has ever been to ICU. (source: [https://data.gov.sg/dataset/covid-19-vaccination?view\_id=f79f003d-17e3-4e46-857e-f9959b149ba3&amp;resource\_id=fd882470-fc1c-45ce-8aec-e4c1c898f80c](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/covid-19-vaccination?view_id=f79f003d-17e3-4e46-857e-f9959b149ba3&amp;resource_id=fd882470-fc1c-45ce-8aec-e4c1c898f80c) )\-"" enable authorities to issue health risk warnings and notices quickly "" - 1) why would health risk warnings still be a thing if people are not required to declared their covid positive status? So health warnings are just done in case somebody decides to declare their status for the above mentioned reasons? So just rather randomThe comparison of tracetogether with seat belts is a statistical joke. Lets compare the mortality rate of today's Covid with the mortality changes one get in a car accident. If we make cars illegal, there wont be any car accidents either.I also see more and more places getting these automated Tracetogether gates, which mean money is spent and we are doubling down on access restriction. rant out",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/t8dtj9/tracetogether_revisited/

They'll claim to be from some reputable company like Grab, Shopee, NUS, etc. If you entertain them, they'll pass on your contact to another scammer on WhatsApp who will ask you to do a simple task for cash. Basically, you'll like some YouTube video, screenshot it and send it over. They claim they're helping influencers farm likes. If you pass this, they'll reward you with around $20, and ask you to contact some 'receptionist' on Telegram. He will add you into a telegram group to do the YouTube likes task, and each like gives you around $4. After doing a few liking tasks, they'll ask you to do the so called 'prepaid' tasks, where you will pay them a sum of money and they promise to return you your initial payment + a bonus. Seems like they're getting more and more creative with their scams. Needless to say, do not ever send any money to them regardless of how tempting it may be.

She did not make this transaction and I couldn't find the transaction on her Ipad's purchase history.Odd thing is, she did not receive the usual ""Use SMS-OPT xxxxx"" nor ""A transaction of SGD xxxxx"" on her phone for that date nor the settled date, I looked through her SMS history and confirmed it.This ringed the alarm bell in me, what if she didn't browse through the statement carefully? Its just $11 and she could have easily missed it.It also reminded me that when I use my Citi Mastercard to tap on public transport, I don't get any SMS notification even when I set the notification threshold as $1. I think it is because the initial auth amount placed by SMRT was just $0.01 and only when they settle, they settled for whatever the actual fare was, and the notification was probably only set up for auth.

At the time, i thought this made sense, because it meant that a certain number of appointments are reserved for walk in cases who might have gotten sick in the afternoon or something like that.But now it seems that no slots are reserved for walk in patients and all the appointment slots are quickly taken up in the morning before 9 am. So if someone gets sick later, it seems like they are screwed and have to go see a private clinic instead, which charges much higher prices? Just seems like the system screws people over who happen to get sick after 9 am and can't afford the fees that private clinics charge.Edit : **I am aware that you can book an appointment at 10 pm the previous days online**, the issue is that if you are sick after 9 am, you have no chance of seeing a polyclinic doctor because all appointment slots are already taken up, not even if you call or try to do a walk in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/xwwpex/polyclinics_no_longer_reserve_appointment_slots/

A family is sitting nearby with their bags and luggage. Anyone else on the train could see that they put their things as close to them as possible, trying their best not to take up space. Lady walks in, without any provocation, and shouts at the family, saying that they make it impossible to sit down in the seat next to the father, because of his luggage. The father moves his luggage out of the way best he can, but she still shouts at them, calling the situation (or them) ""outrageous"".At the next stop, a new passenger boards the train and she sits next to the father - in the ""impossible to sit down"" seat. The voice recording was after this.As in the picture, the woman had her umbrella on the seat. At the next stop, an elderly man boarded and wanted to sit in the seat next to her. She had to move her bag and umbrella away for him to sit.I was preparing to leave at the next stop, the family was going to get off at the same stop. I stood up and told the woman - ""Look, your umbrella was on the other seat and the other passenger didn't have to shout at you to get you to make space. Why did you have to shout at them? Have some compassion."" She shouted back at me something like ""Speak for yourself!"" or something along those lines. Still mega confused about that.Talked to the family when we got off and found out that they are tourists and they've already been having a really tough time finding their way since leaving the airport. To add to that they had to deal with this. Up to this point, they have never expressed anger or replied rudely or even raised their voice.Am in contact with them, and told them that if they need any more help or if they want to make a report, to just drop me a text.Still pretty appalled at what happened.

Hence why the private vehicle population is staying high even though COE prices keep going up.I believe other than how straight Orchard Road is, I think it ought to be a gold (silver?) standard by which more roads should be arranged in the rest of Singapore.It is an incredibly walkable area with plenty of space for pedestrians and cyclists to share side by side, it is well protected from traffic, and there is still space for green verges. One way traffic reduces the likelihood of accidents though I personally would prefer if they depended less on traffic lights and more on winding paths to control speeds. It also forces drivers to plan ahead and be methodical while driving, lowering their speed lest they miss a turn. It also may make it a decision factor to take public transport instead if the route proves to be more of a hassle.Now look at the vast majority of minor roads in heartland areas. 2 way traffic with Singapore's hallmark straight-as-an-arrow roads, with as many lanes squeezed in as possible taking away space from pedestrian footpaths, making it a pain to walk that 2 or 3 bus stops away to the MRT station to save money AND time even though it is not far, much less cycle it.By just taking your typical 6 lane bi-directional road, cutting it down to a one way 3 lane road that turns off both left and right into respective buildings/estates, we can give pedestrians and cyclist so much more space to move around without coming into conflict with each other. Making the roads wind a bit like they did at Hougang St 21 and several Silver zones have also proven to curb speeds and create jutting pockets we can plant bigger trees for shade.I think we have the building blocks to make more non-trunk roads convenient for peds and cyclists, at the expense of drivers if it comes down to it. But it just annoys me that even though there have been initiatives to retrofit some areas as I've mentioned above, a lot of new roads in new estates are still being designed to make driving in and out more convenient than it is to walk and cycle around, like the new Bidadari Park Drive (though to be fair they included a cycle path on one side of it).Will narrower, winding one way roads affect the bus transportation network? Yea it will, especially if you need to travel along specific routes in both directions.

t3_1bhnlvg,Annual Leave and Singaporeans' Well-Being,reddit,Employment,2024-03-18 18:37:00,0.8477,"While we talk a lot about the poor TFR, enhanced paternity leave scheme and general unhappiness with work/life balance, I noticed that we rarely discuss annual leave.The Employment Act mandates only 7 days' minimum annual leave, but I wonder what effect it would have on overall well-being and maybe even TFR if we revised it significantly upwards, say to a minimum 20 days, both to provide more paid free time and also to signify a change in mindset.The MOM stats tabled in Parliament in 2023 show the following leave breakdown by monthly wage levels:Below $2,000: 12.4 days$2,000 - 4,999: 16.3 days$5,000+: 20.4 daysIt seems to me, with the bulk of our grads and youngsters in the below $5,000 range, a move to 20 days annual leave would give them more time in their relative youth for hobbies, self-discovery and maybe to form relationships earlier in life. Better than a once-off two week paternity leave bonus, giving around one working week extra every year will also allow parents more time to spend with their children as they grow up.Allied to this, there needs to be an effort to ensure that all leave is taken and not forfeited / cashed in. It goes without saying that given our deleterious working culture, there are workplaces where this never happens. I suspect the MOM figures really only tell half the story; I used to regularly get shafted on annual leave myself.What do you all think?*Bearing in mind also that the higher two figures may be skewed upwards as many MNCs already provide 20/25 days' annual leave based on their global internal policies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bhnlvg/annual_leave_and_singaporeans_wellbeing/

t3_smn0bb,Why do Singaporeans not insist on better bike infrastructure?,reddit,Transport,2022-02-07 10:25:00,0.983,"I know... I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity &amp; the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people.  Bear with me 1 sec.   Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun &amp; healthy.  Climate, gradient &amp; size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation.  If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you.  Rain just cools you more!  I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry &amp; clean up.Only problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful.  Regulations &amp; design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right.  The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs &amp; trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.Today I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub.  First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail.  Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise).  There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why?? Second photo shows an inaccurate Google Maps which made me think I could easily cross Merdeka Bridge to get to Sports Hub - I encountered multiple staircases to cross the bridge, barrier walls preventing me from getting to the PCN by the river, and eventually found the only real connection was to take an unmarked crossing across the high-speed entrance to Stadium Rd, where the median isn't even wide enough to safely pause with a cycle. No directional / informational signs anywhere.Serious question - I don't mean to bash Singapore.  I certainly understand as the city has evolved, there would be some poorly planned older infrastructure.  But why does the population accept such poorly designed NEW stuff?  Cycling is historically not a rich man's hobby - it's a means of movement, health &amp; access for the masses. I just struggle to understand why people have tolerated this ongoing prioritization of cars in Singapore.  Is there an advocacy group here that works with the government to increase equitable access to public spaces during infrastructure planning decisions?Thank youEDIT: Thank you everyone for the largely supportive and civil discussion! Really lifted my spirits and gives me hope for the future of Singapore because I had the wrong impression that no one else cared about this. Apologies that I couldn't keep up with all the comments as I had a lot of work to do.  Regarding the weather.. Singapore simply is not THAT hot.  Mean temp is &lt;28C and it doesn't fluctuate much. Compared to Dubai or South India, or summers in Europe or Americas or Australia, it's really not hot at all.  Sunshine is not dangerous - it's actually really good for you!  See [https://youtu.be/2Zzo4SJopcY](https://youtu.be/2Zzo4SJopcY) Singapore has no typhoons (very rarely), hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, sleet or ice.  There is a reason a person can bike 4x as far as they can walk: it's EASIER.  So less effort, less sweat, plus more breeze to cool down.  Just a fact. OK, it's hot, but it's not the hottest place in the world - it's totally within functional range (IMHO)https://preview.redd.it/8ez1i2ik1eg81.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcdcbba5911136248fe8f464e9cc16bd392b7dd3https://preview.redd.it/nel707ik1eg81.jpg?width=434&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e80f5bb97455a54f0bc74fea3c93ecefd351009",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/smn0bb/why_do_singaporeans_not_insist_on_better_bike/

t3_zdpl85,Unpopular Opinion: Singapore wastes human capital of our youth and sets us up to fail,reddit,Education,2022-12-06 00:29:00,0.8253,"Edit 5: TLDR; Aligning the academic year of our MOE schools and universities will give every Singaporean regardless of NS obligations an additional year to work post-degree. An additional year of income at the start of your working life, with compounding potentially translates to a major boost to your savings. This will be a boon for our economy since Singaporeans enter the workforce earlier and get to contribute more over our lifetimes. NS has nothing to do with my point, though a 3-month disruption would do wonders - I am very proud of my SAF service, and nothing will change that - I still carry my 11B around all the time. Those who think I'm salty about NS are missing the point.Edit 6: Please focus on the academic year misalignment in the discussion. The loss is an entire year, not 8 months - the other 4 are spent in kindergarten while kids in other countries have started P1 in August - our children have to wait for January.Edit 7: This is my last edit - my whining aside, I hope people carefully consider the effect of the misaligned academic year on our society. What is the economic loss? Who benefits from the cheap labor of a-level grads waiting for uni? I do not care what you think of me, but please; at the end of the day, I hope you will walk away with the sense that the misalignment of the academic year is a serious issue with grave national consequences that we can actually address through some firm decisions by the leadership; that this is an issue worth advocating.nvm, let's see how sordid this can get. keep the hate rolling guys, I want the karma.Edit 8: To those doubting my age. [https://imgur.com/a/Vf1pX3N](https://imgur.com/a/Vf1pX3N)Singapore's education system has an unconventional Jan-Dec academic year for MOE schools. This forces us to waste 8 months between graduation from school and university. We are a year older when entering university than students from other countries. Add in 2 years for guys who serve NS, and you can see that the average Singaporean throws away 2 years in the prime of their lives into a black hole (1 year for girls and 3 for guys). It need not be the case, especially for the year that is due to the academic year misalignment. I shudder to think of the sheer economic cost of this folly (of course, the impact on individuals is more important here, but as a nation we all suffer from this policy economically).I am 25 yo right now and only have a masters degree to my name, and just 4 months of working experience apart from internships. I tried to make up for lost time, finishing up my bachelors and masters in 4 years. But we're just too far behind. Being in the US, I feel like an utter joke, and I feel like a complete failure especially when my American/Chinese/Indian/European/Japanese friends the same age as me talk about the years of working experience they have under their belt or how they're defending their PhD dissertations. My supervisor at work is nearly a year younger than me. If I go in for my PhD now my advisor may be younger than me (if they're a fresh assistant professor). It is downright humiliating, in a way. Our biological clocks are ticking down, brains become duller and at some point starting a family becomes more important than your career. And MOE wonders why more Singaporeans don't pursue PhDs. We don't have time and are growing white hairs before we get the chance, dammit.Edit: Seriously, guys. The Government wants us to fight for our lunch and handicaps us by putting us in school uniforms when future FTs are in uni (literally). I'm advocating for a realignment of our academic year so that at a minimum, Singaporean women are able to get the same starting line as people from normal countries.Edit 2: I reiterate, this is NOT about NS. Why are Singaporeans stuck in JC uniforms when our counterparts overseas are already enrolling in uni? What is the economic cost of 1 year of earnings \* number of singaporeans affected by misalignment? NS is a totally different issue, but this affects everyone.Edit 3: My failures are my own. I own them, I do not blame anyone for them. What I am advocating is an improvement in national policy; that is, to get rid of the academic year misalignment. Difficult decisions will have to be made wrt resource planning to make this realignment work. But it can be done and will benefit future generations of Singaporeans. Our economy will benefit from squeezing an additional years' worth of work from degree graduates.Edit 4: The academic year misalignment means that schools start their academic years in January, while tertiary institutions typically start at a different time of year. This causes a gap in our educations, the effect of which is we lose a year of working life. Both poly/uni grads are affected, though to a different extent. It also affects you regardless of the path you took to get to poly/uni. If we realign our school system to enrol pri 1 students just 3 months earlier, we can give them an entire year of additional working life post diploma/degree that means more earnings and more savings compounded over the years, and more labor for our economy",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zdpl85/unpopular_opinion_singapore_wastes_human_capital/

Might be looking at their smartphones taking the next job (flouting traffic rules), or simply expecting you to give way.* As a passenger: their constant abrupt braking/accelerating makes us nauseous (why are they not technically affluent with controlling their vehicle despite doing it for many hours a day bewilders me) . Picking-up/dropping off (esp with grab these days) is a whole separate story, with them not wanting to pick you up/drop you off at certain places, or expecting you to WALK OVER to them when you're already in an accessible place waiting for them to start with. I've had multiple occasions where the taxi meter was already running WHEN I boarded the taxi (booked via grab). For the other private hire modes, there's many occasions where they hit the I've arrived button BEFORE texting me to confirm the exact location. What happened to the grace period?* As a driver: This one's the worst. Driving like they own the roads, beating amber lights, sudden filtering to pick up a passenger, expecting to be given way the moment they turn on their signal lights (if they even do), turning on their signal lights AFTER they start filtering into the lane, driving diagonally towards lane 1 the moment they get on the highway (sometimes dangerously), road hogging obliviously on lane 1, filtering towards the exit from lane 1 in a dangerous manner, NOT giving way to emergency vehicles (or anyone in general), honking at others when they get their way (despite them NOT giving way to start with - they lost the ""battle"") tailgating emergency vehicles to go faster, tailgating, brake checking, submitting fraudulent claims to insurers when involved in an accident etc. Over a decade of driving experience here; I've seen it all.These people really feel like scum. I understand they're doing it for a living but, can they do it properly? I also understand that not everyone's like that, but at this point there's way too many bad sheep out there, especially since the advent of Grab/Uber.Side note, I really think their PHV logos should be luminous (like our triangle P plates for new drivers) so that we're able to easily identify them at night. I personally switch to a more defensive driving style when I notice taxis/phvs right around me.Would definitely like to hear from others regarding your experiences with Taxis/PHVs, good or bad!Edit: realised the video's compressed by reddit again and the light turning green seconds before the encounter is not obvious.Edit 2: people seem to think that one minor mistake according to a ‚Äútheory‚Äù book, when the action is really just out of minimising traffic during peak hours is more worth highlighting than someone cutting in recklessly.

t3_1brho0v,Issue with SG Healthcare: Doctor working hours and why it affects you,reddit,Healthcare,2024-03-30 21:17:00,0.2593,"I’m a doctor working in Singapore. I think we’ve reached a point where most Singaporeans understand the main issues with our healthcare system. The system is tough on everyone including the nurses and allied health professionals.Junior doctors have many woes including renumeration, dealing with bureacracy, healthcare worker abuse. For this post, I would like to focus solely on the **most absurd** aspect of our current healthcare system: the working hours for doctors.Personally, this is most ridiculous existing issue and requires urgent, if not immediate change. The current system is outdated and disregards patient safety.It is easy for the general public to dismiss this issue and say things like “doctors knew what they were signing up for” etc, but this problem affects every Singaporean. Anyone could end up seeking treatment in a public hospital. Imagine if your loved one was being operated on by a doctor who has not slept in 24 hours. This possibly occurs on a daily basis. **Current Working Hours:**The average junior doctor reaches the hospital around 6-6.30am. This varies according to patient load in the hospital department, some doctors reach earlier at 5am or earlier based on manpower needs.The main reason for this early reporting time  varies depending on speciality and should be kept for a separate post. The main focus of this post is the call system.**Call System (Night Duty)**Overnight doctor duties in public hospitals are covered by the “call” system. This system is outdated and the main cause of the problem. Nurses operate on a shift system where continuous working hours are capped to the shift. A&E doctors also use shift systems. Some hospitals have progressed to a “night float” system which also caps continuous working hours. **However most hospitals still operate using the “call system” for doctors.**What exactly is a call system?Simply put, when doctors are “on call”, they are scheduled to cover the night shift for that day. The catch is that they work the whole day, cover the night shift, then proceed to work the next day as well.When doctors leave work after a call, it’s called going “post-call”. The official postcall timing is about 12pm, but this is subject to patient load. It is not unusual to leave at 2-3pm if needed, with the not-so-occasional horror stories of doctors going postcall at 6pm. Eg if a doctor is scheduled for “call” on 1st April; they will arrive at work about 6-6.30am on 1st April, work the whole day and night, then proceed to work the next morning as well. Ideally they will leave by 12pm on 2nd April and will have some rest before reporting to work as usual at 6am on 3rd April. An official “postcall timing” of 12pm makes each call a 30 hour shift. This means that every morning, you have doctors in SG with little to no sleep reviewing patients, ordering blood test and scans, precribing meds. Isn’t this crazy?Some hospital departments have tried to fix this problem by implementing an “8am postcall” system. This would mean that doctors would be able to leave the hospital at 8am after their call ends, bringing the average worktime per call to a ~26 hour shift. This prevents doctors from working the morning after the call which reduces the risk of sleep-deprived making medical errors.**What needs to be done?**Mandatory 8 am post-call timings should be a MOH priority. 26 hour shifts still sound ridiculous but it is still a first step in the right direction. Doctors should not be allowed to work continuously for >24 hours given the possibly harm to patients. **TLDR:** In Singapore, you have doctors on 30 hour shifts examining, prescribing meds and even performing surgery on your loved ones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1brho0v/issue_with_sg_healthcare_doctor_working_hours_and/

Of course Companies still can deny on terms of operational and business reasons. Recently my company announced its policy regarding this and I'm super curious on how patronizing other companies have it.Share what's your company policy if you have one and let's see how patronizing it is. I work in a manufacturing firm. My company's policy applies to all levels of employees so from the top execs to the lowest technician. This is my company's policy:**Flexi Place** \> work from anywhere but only up to 1 day a week.**Flexi Time** \> plus minus 1.5hr start and end work time. Normally 8:00 - 17:30. You can choose to start work anytime between 6:30 to 9:30 but you still have to work 9.5hours inclusive of 1hr lunch break everyday. meaning you cannot work less today because you worked more yesterday or work less today and work more tomorrow and also no OT pay. **Flexi load** **>** Basically just calculate per day pay that's it. You have to apply in advance as well or absence counts as AWOL.Also no OT pay at all if any of the above is requested.,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hijyna/flexible_work_arrangement_request_tripartite/

This enables us to manage our IP portfolio sustainably so that we can continue to meet our policyholder's long-term healthcare needs amidst double-digit medical inflation in Singapore.On average, the premium increase of our IP main plans is 16%. The premium increase of our IP main plans with riders averages 29%. These premium adjustments commensurate with our overall IP claims (main plans and riders). In 2023, we experienced average bill inflation from restructured hospitals of up to 51%.The premium adjustments are made against the backdrop that premiums have not changed for a significant period. The premiums of our private hospital main plan (Enhanced Preferred) were unchanged for the past two years. We also did not increase the premiums of our restructured hospital main plans (Enhanced Advantage and Enhanced Basic) for nine years, since 2015. In fact, a premium reduction of our restructured hospital main plans took place in 2021 during the COVID19 pandemic.We also remain conscientious in our approach and currently do not subject our customers to higher premiums when they make a claim.The premium adjustments, which differ across age bands, apply to all IncomeShield plans and riders from 1 September 2024, upon renewal of the policy.

While news outlets focused on the headlines, the subtle shift to double sessions (Not permanent) for Pri 1-2 students at the holding site appears to have gone largely unnoticed.For many working parents like myself, this seemingly minor change carries significant weight. The current lack of aftercare options for the afternoon session puts us in an impossible bind.

This will increase vehicular traffic along Tampines North Drive 2, now a through route for cars, potentially making it noisier for the residents living there and less safe for pedestrians, thus discouraging active modes of travel for short trips to nearby amenities like schools and childcare centres.Motorists can now save a few minutes to get into and out of the estate where it was previously not possible to, while public transport commuters on bus services 46, 129, and 298 will also have to take longer to get to where they are going as their bus waits behind queuing cars making that right turn.What do you guys think about this?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ercqec

t3_165dgci,Tomorrow is Cooling-off Day. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about ECDA‚Äôs response to the Kinderland case.,reddit,Education,2023-08-30 12:33:00,0.8484,"Yes, I know that the President has no policymaking power, and the PAP doesn‚Äôt want us to conflate the issues at the ballot box. But as much as they want us to compartmentalise away the inconvenient things, as a citizen and parent of a young child I cannot compartmentalise my unease with the general state of affairs. I will admit that it might influence my vote.I consider myself an intelligent and rational voter. I know which issues belong in which bucket and how not to conflate them. I am also not a single-issue voter. But the Kinderland case and ECDA‚Äôs almost-casual response to has hung over me these couple of days. In short, it makes my blood boil that the abuser was not at least ordered to take a leave of absence during ECDA‚Äôs investigation.Here‚Äôs CNA‚Äôs timeline of events ([https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-teacher-charged-child-abuse-timeline-3734046](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-teacher-charged-child-abuse-timeline-3734046)):* **Aug 10:** ECDA launched its investigation after being alerted to the incidents by ""a former employee"". It did not say who the former employee was.* **Aug 17:** Kinderland said it was made aware of the videos when it was contacted by ECDA on Aug 17. Three staff members of the Woodlands Mart centre met ECDA and were shown the videos.* **Aug 18:** Another Kinderland staff member met ECDA and was shown the videos.* Kinderland headquarters started a disciplinary inquiry and met with Lin. The principal of Woodlands Mart and Lin contacted the parents of the affected children.* **Aug 28:** Videos emerge on social media of the incidents at Woodlands Mart preschool. Lin was arrested and [she was fired](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kinderland-preschool-woodlands-mart-alleged-abuse-videos-teacher-spf-ecda-3729716).From the above facts, we can safely surmise the following:* ECDA had seen the videos at least as early as 17 Aug, if not 10 Aug. * The preschool teacher was only fired on 28 Aug. Whether it was at ECDA‚Äôs behest, we do not know. But what we do know is that ECDA has the power to bar a teacher from the preschool sector, which they had done earlier today.* Based on the timeline, no new material evidence had surfaced between 17 Aug and today. Neither does the timeline suggest that ECDA had concluded its investigation by today.* Chronologically, this means that ECDA barred the teacher only after the public uproar emerged. We do not know whether they would have done so anyway. But these are the optics.At the minimum, this means that someone at ECDA had seen the videos on 17 Aug or 10 Aug and still allowed the abuser to continue working as usual for the past 2 weeks or so.It baffles me that the abuser was not put on a leave of absence during the investigation. After all, there is very recent precedence for this at the very top of the government. The following questions have to be asked:* Does ECDA suffer from a worrying lack of urgency or empathy for the plight of small, defenseless kids?* Have our kids, our very own flesh and blood, become mere digits to them?* Do optics weigh more on ECDA‚Äôs mind than the welfare of toddlers?* Or have abuse cases become so routine that they do not provoke any special urgency?We know the government will do a thorough post-mortem of their response and find a good rationale for every step taken or not taken. The road to the top of a government career is paved with disarming rationalisations. But I am a parent, and you do not get rationalise my children away. And you cannot paper over the trauma that the victims may carry for the rest of their lives.&#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/165dgci/tomorrow_is_coolingoff_day_but_i_cant_stop/

In light of the death of SGT Raja alleged to be due to a toxic SPF working environment, I felt that I have to post this to let people know my experiences in SPF.I am writing under an alias account to protect my identity. Let‚Äôs see if SPF would doxx me, in hypocrisy to their own laws.This is a story about a broken employee grievance system, written to warn those considering joining this organization. This is my story of my experience in SPF. No names or sensitive information is shared in adherence to Official Secrets Act.Whilst I was being posted to investigation branch, another department‚Äôs IOs warned me about the department I was being posted to. They talked about the toxic people and manager there. At that time, I didn't believe them.As my police tours started, as seen on CNA documentary, I was in charge of handling phone calls on cases from NPCOs. My teammates would work on other tasks.Going in fresh, I did not know what to expect. I asked my allocated mentor what I should look out for when picking up calls. He said, ‚Äòwhen you become more experienced you will know.‚Äô Later on, I asked if he could demonstrate how to handle the phone calls, he picked up one and demonstrated how fast he could handle a call and ended the call within 20s. There was no explanation that came after. This would be his modus operandi for many of his future 'teachings'. With this, I went on tours without the basic explanations on what I should be doing even when I asked.During the course of my tours, I tried to ask my teammates on the tasks and cases, but many denied to share information and told me to ask my mentor instead. People were not forthcoming in sharing knowledge ‚Äì Knowledge that was essential to do my job.In addition, there was no proper orientation. Every time I needed a document or resource to do my work, I had to go beg around for them. In contrast, other departments have starter packs with documents to get them started. Their teammates were forthcoming in sharing. I envied them.As I naively believed that the phone calls were about speed, including making decisions as my mentor had demonstrated so, I tried to pick up all the phones calls that came during tour. As a result, I was overwhelmed.I only found out much later that my teammates were supposed to help pick up the calls. But sadly, they did not inform me or offer to help. They certainly did not notice something was amiss when they were getting little to no calls. As a result, I was making mistakes in my work. I kept forgetting stuff as I got overwhelmed by calls during tours and outside tours.As I made work mistakes during tour, some of my teammates began to say: ‚Äòif you don't know something, you must ask‚Äô. In my thoughts, I was thinking, I did ask but I get bounced around or get nonchalant answers except from a few people. This is just my bias, but I think in the private sector, people would know better. They would know that those with experience have to also play their part to share.The repercussions are that during tour, I made some decisions and some did not work out. I then get blamed for them. Generally, there was a stance that did not tolerate mistake ‚Äì which one can argue to be both good and bad.I raised the issue on my mentor to my manager. I told her in a nice manner that my mentor was not really teaching me the things I needed. Based on my impression, my manager talked to my mentor to take corrective action. At first, things seemed to get better, because my mentor would sit down with me to explain a subject that was essential for my work. However, this only happened once. The nonchalant teaching continued afterwards. If I did not ask, nothing is ever shared or taught. But to be fair to the manager, she did try to share some teachings. Am I supposed to know what to ask when the information is something that is privileged to those with experience? Work mistakes continued. With the overload in work, I continued to make mistakes during work, including typos. I was also blamed for not coping well.Thankfully, there was a teammate who was kind enough to share the resources that his own mentor shared with him. If not, I could not even do my basic work.However, as my work performance was not improving, my manager became more and more abusive. She became fiercer and fiercer in her interactions with me, sometimes shouting my name fiercely out from her room. Months later, she would also fiercely tell me to get out of her room and to leave her department. Hostile interactions continued as she gave a ‚Äòblack‚Äô face during our interactions, including when I greeted her in the morning. (The boss made all sorts of micro-aggressions too, not like she recognize them)At some point, the narrative that I did not ask has become entrenched, even though 9 out of 10 times I can assuredly, based on my conscience, say that I did. I asked to the best of what I could, without the privileged information held by the mentors. (I was even blamed later for asking about everything. Just how self-serving can these people get?) Later on, I found out that my mentor was covering his ass by speaking poorly about me to my manager. Given that she is, in my opinion, a Machiavellian covert vulnerable narcissist who cannot take disagreement, it was clear that he was agreeing with her own views on my incompetence to protect his position.One month in, I sat with my big boss to tell him that I wanted to change department. He dismissed my concerns, showing a lack of interest.The next day, when I was back in the office, I was shocked when my boss angrily told me off for talking bad about her to the boss behind her back. Since when did sharing concerns about a manager become bad talking? That was when I knew that what I told my big boss was being conveyed to my manager. I still remember her saying fiercely: ‚ÄúI hate people who talk bad about me behind my back the most!‚Äù Given the fierce backlash from trying to raise an issue, one would be mad to raise issues to the big boss.So I tolerated such a department. A few months in, when I finally found out that I was not supposed to take all the calls from NPCOs during AIO tour and told my manager, she blamed me for not asking. This blaming continued even though she said at the start with such gusto to me that there will be no blaming in this department, after making negative assumptions that I was blaming someone for a case that was passed down to me, that was not done well.Deteriorating treatments continued, and my mental health deteriorated. I was getting dark thoughts. I sat down with my big boss while censoring my words on my manager and I was referred to PPSD for therapy. I knew this had to be done because I knew something would happen if I did not leave this department.This time, it was my big boss who said, ‚Äòwhy didn't you tell me?‚Äô In my mind, I was thinking, you were conveying what I said to my boss, and it only leads to blaming and scolding. You think I would be able to tell you? I would only be shooting myself in the leg.Nine months in, I was finally transferred to another department. I ceased my therapy then as the colleagues there were friendly, professional, and forthcoming with their sharing and I was able to do my work well. Some of the work is even more advanced than my previous work. At one point, I handed in a file that was well done to my big boss. There, he asked me, ‚Äòwhy is it that you couldn‚Äôt cope previously?‚Äô That was when I could confirm, he didn‚Äôt really care.Whilst I was in the new department, the commander held a no supervisor chat with the employees. Before I went to the talk, I was clearly told to send the minutes of that chat to a supervisor, who was not supposed to be there. Ultimately, I did not send those minutes out to the unauthorized supervisor. But at the same time, I could not raise my issue or give my true feelings about the organization to the commander as that information could be leaked. I am sure my colleagues felt the same, given their lackluster response.Ultimately, I decided to quit SPF, given how dysfunctional the organization was. There was no procedural justice or any effective form of grievance handling of verbally abusive managers.One year later, I still get dark thoughts. During one such attack, I wrote in to a minister to look into the matter. Action was finally taken. Info was sent to the division‚Äôs feedback and IAO called me. I thought something was finally getting done. I thought that someone was finally going to recognize that there was a problem here.What happened during the interview was not pretty. I felt that the Internal Affairs Officer had deemed me to be a troublemaker, saying that he knew that the big boss had engaged me on the matter even though I said that he did not. However, in truth, my discussion with the big boss on that matter in the entire nine months did not exceed ten lines. Okay, maybe twenty lines just to be generous. He told me that the big boss did a lot of things for me behind the scenes and asked if I know what had been done for me. I told him that I did not know what actions had been taken. This was my honest perspective as the management only communicated within themselves. Nothing was ever shared with me. No one informed if action was taken against my manager. No one engaged me to ask me more about the problem that I faced in my department. If they did engage anyone, I can only speculate that they talked to my manager. Weird isn‚Äôt it? When someone raise an issue, they do not try to learn more about the issue from the person raising the issue, but talk to the manager and ask her opinion on the person raising the issue. What kind of organization does not ensure the anonymity of the persons raising issues?The internal affairs officer asked why I did not seek counseling or treatment after. I told him I was doing alright in the new department. I was also thinking: ‚Äòafter I left, I didn‚Äôt, because I would have to pay for my own counseling and I was not employed for a year already.‚Äô During this year, I fought hard against my dark thoughts using self-help cognitive therapy.After a year of investigations, the internal affairs officer called me and said that they did not find my boss‚Äô behavior to be excessive. This was verbatim. I told him that some of the people I know had left SPF ‚Äì people whom I know were in the new department which the manager took over. He told me that people were leaving en masse from the public service not just SPF.So, instead of trying to fix the problem, SPF buried it and condoned it? That is what I thought.Given how negative the initial portions of the interview were by the internal affairs officer, I could only speculate how SPF processed my provided information when the minister forwarded the information to the feedback department of the police. I speculate that my division and my manager got hold of the information first, gathered information from people in my ex-department. If that was the case, how could the investigation and information gathered not be biased? The manager herself would be exerting pressure on those providing information. The same goes when the IAO officer was interviewing witnesses. Did the witnesses have to provide leave of absence with supervisors, and was there any pressure exerted onto them to be politically correct, given that the manager has rank and position?And this concludes my story. I am trying to move on with life, trying to find positive interpretations of growth and peace to my dark thoughts and all the gaslighting. I considered suing SPF but it would take a toll on me financially, emotionally, and mentally.I am writing this post because I believe people need to know what they are getting into when they sign that contract with SPF. They need to know that some parts of SPF are rotten and that one may experience a department and division that do not care about the mental wellbeing or the procedural justice that pertains to employee grievance. These structures may exist on paper, but are sorely lacking in reality. SPF would surely disagree given how well the persons involved can cover their asses.I would like to end off by asking people who are looking to join SPF, not to believe my words at face value because this story is just my perspective, but to think critically for themselves, talk to friends who left SPF and see what their experiences are. Not just look at the rosy pictures painted by yearly advertisements. Be sure to give careful consideration to the monetary bond for those who sign on.With all that is said, my conscience is clear. I have been blamed for not being resilient, not coping with my work, being unsuitable for being an IO, and having poor job fit, but I know better. I produced high quality work on complex cases that was recognized by my colleagues and manager at my new department, thanks to proper mentoring in the new department. I know better than to be gaslighted.All that I have posted here are my personal perspectives. I am sure SPF would vehemently disagree given that the letter they sent me (portions attached below) had disavowed all legitimacy of my claims. After all, despite providing some evidence on chat, they have found ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô to substantiate my allegations.Now, after two years of fighting my inner demons, I am taking a short course, with many thanks to skills future (kudos to the government on that) to pivot industry. I hope that everyone would be able to find workplaces that are not abusive and workplaces with functional employee grievance systems.I am merely sharing my story because I believe people deserve to know. Be careful joining an organization that is so good at managing impressions. If they can with their conscience look at me and say that there are no problems, then so be it. The symptoms are all there. I fully empathize with the experiences of SGT Raja because I have experienced similar dysfunctional management where the big boss sides with the boss and there is no form of effective grievance handling in the force. There is no form of 3rd party investigation or whistleblowing within. You raise an issue against your colleague, your colleague will know. You raise an issue against your boss, your boss will know. They will then beat you down like they have done so towards me, like during the initial portions of the IAO investigation. Own self check own self. This is the consequences. If you are thinking that this story sounds ludicrous, I am thinking the same.IAO officer got the guts to say to me on the phone that his investigations revealed that the manager‚Äôs treatment of me was not excessive and that SPF was losing a lot of people just like the other parts of public service, but got no courage to put it down on the reply he sent me. I can only conclude that the investigation was slipshod, biased towards the manager and never really finding out why I couldn‚Äôt cope. I can speculate that all sorts of problems are buried in this manner. I challenge SPF to send my investigation file and SGT Raja's for audit by a truly independent body, or even better, open those documents up for public scrutiny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/158u6hl/redditor_shares_experience_with_toxic_work/

But I was thinking that since it takes a long time for the backend to compute the fare and return the card balance, why not make all terminals store the balances which are synced with each other. When someone taps, the current terminal computes balance and then displays it, and then afterwards sync it to the main server which would then proceed to sync to the rest of the terminals + the app? Top ups would go the other way around?With an upper limit assumption of 10million users, each terminal has to store 10 million card ids + 10 million balances. Assuming each value is 4 bytes, that's 150Mb at most so it's not unreasonable. Most thumbdrives contain hundreds of times the space anyway.

t3_13ecpal,"Are Therapists (Occupational Therapist/ Physiotherapist/ Speech Language Therapist) being paid less in 2023? Based on the salary guidelines published by NCSS, the starting salary for Therapists decreased from 2022. Anyone knows why?",reddit,Employment,2023-05-11 04:14:00,0.9549,"The salary guidelines published by NCSS for FY2022 indicated that Therapist (Degree) have a Starting Salary of $3800 (Highlighting the amount for Degree holders here because*see explanation below)Recently, NCSS published the salary guidelines for FY2023 (with effect from April 2023) and indicated that Therapist have a starting salary of $3480.The Reference Point salary for Therapist also decreased from $5510 in FY2022 to $5120 in FY2023. ""Reference Point denotes those who are competent on the job...""It is shocking to see a drastic decrease in salary for Therapists. On the FY2023 sheet, it stated that ‚ÄúThe FY23 guidelines are not directly comparable with previous years‚Äô guidelines due to changes in mapping of job roles. Please refer to the following links for the Skills Frameworks‚Äù. Upon clicking the link for ‚ÄúSkills Framework for Healthcare‚Äù, the information presented in the website, downloadable pdf and excel sheet elaborated the roles and responsibilities of various roles. However, the information presented does not seem to justify the change (decrease in salary). Unless I am missing out something?Regardless, to be realistic, how much can the job roles for Therapists change?The footnote next to the Therapist states ‚ÄúOccupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Speech-Language Therapists are required to be registered with the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC). Please refer to the AHPC website for more details‚Äù These therapists are classified as allied health professionals, like the therapists that can be found in acute/community hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centres and many other settings. The roles and responsibilities of therapists have been well established and regulated and I assume it shouldn‚Äôt change much under NCSS through the ""mapping of job roles"". Any Therapists under NCSS mind sharing how much your roles changed in 2023?*To be able to practice as a OT/PT/SLT in Singapore, one of the requirements is to have a recognised qualification listed by AHPC. The Diploma in Occupational Therapy/Physiotherapy programme at NYP was ceased. Currently, all newly minted local OT/PTs are from SIT and they graduate with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. The SLT programme was introduced at SIT much later and the pioneer batch has yet to graduate. Moreover, under the list of recognised qualifications by AHPC, majority of the overseas qualifications minimally require a Bachelor‚Äôs or Master‚Äôs. The graduates from NYP were invited to convert their Diploma to Degree with SIT and the partnering overseas university (Yes, even the super senior Therapists took a break from work and went back to study). Hence, it would be more meaningful to look at the salary for Therapists who are degree holders. On 3 March 2023, ChannelNewsAsia published an article titled ""Salaries for social service sector to go up by between 4% and 15%‚Äù. The only part that talked about Therapists is ‚ÄúThe wage increases can potentially benefit more than 20,000 employees in the social service sector comprising social workers, therapists, psychologists and early intervention educators among other professions.‚Äù No further elaboration regarding how Therapists‚Äô salary would change.On 14 April 2023, The Straits Times published an article titled ‚ÄúCare staff being paid less this year? Realignment of roles the reason, says NCSS‚Äù. The article did not mention anything about Therapists. I don‚Äôt understand why the salary for therapists is adjusted this way. Anyone care to explain?

I want to clarify that this took place at an off-peak hour (12pm on a Saturday) on a pedestrian path where e-bikes are banned. There was a scaffolding that blocked the T-path that I was approaching, and my spidey-senses told me to check before pushing the stroller out. Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out ‚Äúsorry sorry‚Äù as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number. He told me he seemed apologetic and he let him go, where the rider then dismounted and pushed his e-bike until out of our sight.This is where the struggle comes in: because there was no hit / damage, I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I can‚Äôt report him as I don‚Äôt know what platform he works for. I can‚Äôt get the police involved as there is no license tied to his vehicle, despite a legal ban that was laid out to prevent exactly such incidents. I am not against riders - I deeply respect that they are out there to make their livelihoods, but is your delivery more important the safety of my child, or your own safety? Is the near-miss not enough for you to feel to need to slow down and check if we are okay? Are you going to blatantly ignore this incident and cause a bigger, more painful lesson for someone else or for yourself?Should we have collided, your ‚Äúsorry‚Äù will not un-scar my 9 month old, or me. Your biggest issue would not be a missed delivery, and both your day and mine would have turned out very differently. You‚Äôre still out there making deliveries because I hesitated to push my baby‚Äôs stroller out onto the pedestrian path that I had every right to access on a Saturday afternoon. I don‚Äôt know what else I can do but to share this incident for more awareness towards pedestrians and riders alike to not take our road safety for granted.Thank you for reading this post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/128plry/a_food_delivery_guy_on_an_ebike_almost_hit_my/
