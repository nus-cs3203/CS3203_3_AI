Better to live near school, or are there more fun/better places in the city to live?2) What is cost of living? What should I be expecting for rent/food etc3) Where are best places to go on weekend trips (3-4 day trips)?4) What's the party scene like? How expensive is the party scene? Where are the best areas?Got bunch more, but thats a good start. Remember although I will be a student, I am doing exchange more for the ""experience"" rather than academics.

"So, the JAE posting comes out tomorrow. Like before, I have a couple of questions I hope some of you might be able to help me with.I feel fairly confident that I will be able to make it into a JC. So now, I need help with choosing my subjects. I've already decided on my 3 H2 subjects: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. But I'm still torn between H2 English Language and Linguistics, H1 Economics and H1/H2 Geography as my 4th subject. I've also contemplated taking up H2 Knowledge and Inquiry in place of the General Paper.* Linguistics - I like to read, but I'm not very interested in the emotional side of Literature, analysing how a poem or prose makes you feel. I am, however, interested in the more objective analysis of the language. Truth be told, one of the reasons I've thought about taking this subject was to become a better Grammar Nazi. One who knows for sure what he is talking about as opposed to merely going off his gut feel.* Economics - I don't intend on furthering my studies in this field, but I feel that a basic foundation in Econs would be useful in practical life in the future. I'm also mildy interested in how the Market works.* Geography - I took Geography at the 'O'-levels but didn't do terribly well (B3). I quite liked certain topics, such as Natural Vegetation and Development, but not so much the rest.

Like before, I have a couple of questions I hope some of you might be able to help me with.I feel fairly confident that I will be able to make it into a JC. So now, I need help with choosing my subjects. I've already decided on my 3 H2 subjects: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. But I'm still torn between H2 English Language and Linguistics, H1 Economics and H1/H2 Geography as my 4th subject. I've also contemplated taking up H2 Knowledge and Inquiry in place of the General Paper.* Linguistics - I like to read, but I'm not very interested in the emotional side of Literature, analysing how a poem or prose makes you feel. I am, however, interested in the more objective analysis of the language. Truth be told, one of the reasons I've thought about taking this subject was to become a better Grammar Nazi. One who knows for sure what he is talking about as opposed to merely going off his gut feel.* Economics - I don't intend on furthering my studies in this field, but I feel that a basic foundation in Econs would be useful in practical life in the future. I'm also mildy interested in how the Market works.* Geography - I took Geography at the 'O'-levels but didn't do terribly well (B3). I quite liked certain topics, such as Natural Vegetation and Development, but not so much the rest. H1 Geog has Plate Tectonics, which I didn't like at the 'O's, as well as Globalisation, Hydrologic Processes and Urban Issues, which I'm quite fine with.

"My fellow Singapore based males,This is a small rant focused on a certain percentage of you. It appears that unlike some of you, I am a master at urinating - the Yoda of Urination if you will. Why do I say this? Because I can stand at the correct distance from the urinal and ensure that I do not cover the porcelain, the floor, the wall and everything else in my urine. And I can do this EVERYTIME.Now I understand that we all come in different shapes and size. Some of us are tall, some of us are short, but I refuse to believe that the distance between the urethra and the final location of your urine will vary to any great extent.Yet I still find my office toilet, public toilets and even private toilets at upscale establishments covered in urine. Therefore I am led to believe that there is in fact a discrepancy between the distance of the urethra and the final destination. Furthermore I can only assume that many of you who commit this foul and unhygienic act have weak streams. As such the slight breeze from the air conditioning system may cause this weak stream to blow off course. A simple solution to this is to stand as close to the urinal as humanly possible. Another solution would be to train the weak PC muscles, the potential culprits behind your weak streams, with some Kegels exercises. These two potential solutions will lead to a far more pleasant experience for everyone involved.Whilst you may not mind your own urine soaking every last inch of the bathroom, others do (crazy I know!  Who wouldn't want to gallivant in your steaming liquid waste?). Be a man and piss in the right place. Also wash your hands, there is such a thing as splash back and the argument ""my penis is the cleanest part of me"" just doesn't fly.Also check your fly, no one needs to see the flag at half mast.

"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home. My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes. For example:1)     She flooded my kitchen ‚Äì  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn‚Äôt). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won‚Äôt happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!2)     She didn‚Äôt close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn‚Äôt apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying ‚ÄúWhat to do, it has happened.‚Äù Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don‚Äôt always want to come back at the end of the day.4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms).  Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are ‚ÄúCommited to Serve‚Äù ‚Äì but I think it is just rhetoric and I don‚Äôt see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn‚Äôt big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors. I have to decide whether to renew my maid‚Äôs 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary. Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance.

"Since the last General Election in 2006, Singaporeans have seen how social media helped a relatively unknown senator become president of the most powerful country in the world. Singaporeans have also watched as Egypt and Libya underwent political revolution driven by the desire of the people for change. We live in a time of change. We can taste it in the air. We are surrounded by it, we see it happening and we know that it is possible. This General Election will be one with many firsts. As Singaporeans living in a culture obsessed with being first, it is ironic that it has taken us so long to finally reach this stage of political development. For the first time in decades, opposition parties are challenging most of the seats in Parliament. As a result, many Singaporeans will have a chance to vote for the first time in our lives. For the first time in Singapore's history, voters are truly connected with the campaigns process as we utilize social media to report, investigate, question, criticize, defend and support candidates and parties. For the first time, we are active participants, rather than mere observers. The Internet has become the battlefield, and for the first time, we are on the front lines. Elections are the political marketplace of ideas. Good candidates, policies and parties are introduced or retained while those experiencing low demand are weeded out. As a voter, you have a duty to partake in determining the future of your country by participating in this marketplace of ideas. You must decide whether you are willing to buy what the various parties and candidates are trying to sell you. No matter who you vote for or why, it is vital to remember that your vote determines your future, not your past. The past is often a useful indicia to the future, but this does not hold true in periods of change because changed circumstances result in unpredictable outcomes if the existing model does not adapt rapidly and sufficiently. Globalization, the influx of foreign wealth, and the inability of wages to keep up with inflation indicate changed circumstances. As voters, we must vote for whoever we think can deal with these new issues which may have no analogues in the past. Therefore, vote with regard to the future, not the past.Also, do not be afraid to vote with integrity. Rather, be afraid that if you do not and the outcome is not to your liking, it may well be because you forfeited your chance to create a different future. Do not be held hostage by fear or threats that your government will take less care of you because you voted for a different party. A government holds duties to all its citizens equally, and by voting with integrity, you hold your government accountable. Naturally, I expect that everyone who has voted in the past has voted with integrity, otherwise the concept of the ""peoples' mandate"" would be a farce. Nevertheless, this bears reminding. Vote with integrity.Finally, take comfort in the fact that, no matter who wins in the end, if everyone has voted with integrity and in regards to the future, Singapore will have taken a great step forward from ""A Singapore for the people"" to ""A Singapore for the people, by the people"".May the best men and women win.",The duties that accompany change,"The duties that accompany change Since the last General Election in 2006, Singaporeans have seen how social media helped a relatively unknown senator become president of the most powerful country in the world.

"While walking down the street one day a MP is tragically hit by a truck and dies. The MP's soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. ""Welcome to heaven,"" says St. Peter . ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, yousee, so we're not sure what to do with you."" ""No problem, just let me in,"" says the MP. St. Peter says, ""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then youcan choose where to spend eternity."" ""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in? heaven,"" says the MP. ""I'm sorry, but we have our rules"", replies St.Peter. And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of agreen golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting richat the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time thatbefore he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. ""Now it's time to visit heaven,"" St Peter says. So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good timeand the 24 hours in heaven passes by and St Peter returns. ""Well, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now which will you choose for your eternity?"" St Peter asks. The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers, ""Well, I never would have thought it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I wouldbe happier and better off .. in hell."" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The Devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ""I don't understand,"" stammers the MP. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drankchampagne, and danced and had a great time.

"I realised I can't.  I had already decided I was going to weigh the policies and proposals of the SDP against the PAP. Looking through them, I was torn between the pragmatism of the PAP and the idealism of the SDP. Yet at the same time, caught between the failed promises of the PAP and the naivety of the SDP. It seemed to me my only recourse was to pit the charisma of the ruling party against the enthusiasm of the opposition. I was excited. I got to vote and I got to do it well. Then suddenly a whirl of bad sportsmanship took over with the 'gay video' issue. I was thoroughly disheartened. Not only by the by the lack of grace displayed by the PAP candidates, but also by the way they used the gay issue, weilding it as if it should have anything to do with the elections. My social loyalties were called into question. Nonetheless, I decided to take into account only the way in which the issue was handled as opposed to the issue itself. Afterall, the grace and aplomb in which the opposition reacted to the issue was commendable and while I may have lost faith in one PAP candidate, the subtle chastise that PM Lee slipped into a speech restored my faith in the party as a whole.I was back to thinking objectively. Who did I agree more with? Who did I feel would aid the society more? The opposition candidates seemed strong and motivated, albeit lacking the finesse of the PAP. The PAP riding on it's success seemed confident it could do even more, even if it seemed a little tired. Hurrah for democracy. I got to vote between to parties that seemed equally capable, at least within the constituency. I mean, I do believe the PAP needs to remain in power as a whole, and I have no doubt it will, but for my constituency, I want the best possible party.Then suddenly another hurdle appeared. I was pointed to a video of another ruling party candidate during parliament. It was his address to parliament regarding the 377a issue. Interested in how he might carry himself, I decided to watch only to come away with the sense of unease. His speech did not weigh the practical or pragmatic problems that might arise from the repeal. Instead, it was a bigoted demonisation of the community disguised as a pragmatic discourse. Checking the facts, he lied about his statistics being more thorough regarding the question of whether homosexuality was genetic. I could have looked past this. I told myself I could. It's an wrongly informed opinion that should not affect my vote. But I could not look past what he said next. What he said next was so abhorrent I could hardly believe it came out of his mouth. He claimed that even if homosexuality was genetic, he would not recommend the repeal of the legislature. His reasons of genetic dispostions for kleptomania only fueled the rage within me even more. How could he deny basic rights to people who were born that way? How can someone be so bigoted as to believe that basic rights given to human beings to choose who they want to have sex with can be taken away on the basis of a disorder that is of a comepletely different nature? Could he really not see that whilst kleptomania infringed on someone else's right to ownership, homosexuality infringed on nobody else's rights? Or was this really a clever ploy to discredit the community once more?I have lost faith in objectivity. For the ruling party itself is not willing to remain objective. My heart can no longer allow my mind to consider the credit of candidates whose morals it has a complete disrespect for.tl;dnr: Read it or don't.

I realised I can't.  I had already decided I was going to weigh the policies and proposals of the SDP against the PAP. Looking through them, I was torn between the pragmatism of the PAP and the idealism of the SDP. Yet at the same time, caught between the failed promises of the PAP and the naivety of the SDP. It seemed to me my only recourse was to pit the charisma of the ruling party against the enthusiasm of the opposition. I was excited. I got to vote and I got to do it well.

If every party was in some way fighting for the ""co-driver"" position, knowing for sure that alone they could not form the Parliament, they should have formed a temporary coalition at least this time around, to contest mega-party vs mega-party. The paradox of choice, and the size of the individual parties, may not have won that much confidence. It allowed PAP to deftly play the ""Disadvantages of coalition government"" card too easily. The temporary coalition could have played the ""Unity in Diversity"" card to counter this. That it's ok to have different viewpoints within the same party.Then there's this silent majority? What are the best ways to draw them out? Since establishing that the local new outlets are nothing more than PAP lackeys.I also think that the Opposition plays a bit too much on populist sentiments such as overly harsh criticism of foreign talent, for one thing. It's one thing to recognise the failings of a liberal immigration policy, but it's quite another to effectively demonise an increasingly significant population of the country, some of whom also have citizenships. In future, their kids will have citizenships too, and this population will grow.

I don't mind staying in a hostel for up to a week.I like gaming, playing bass guitar, like rock/punk/metal music, I'm into running, swimming and cycling, I love going out. Can't wait to see what Singapore has in store for me.If you know of anything that could help me out, reply here or send me a private message.CheersEDIT: spelling and more detailsEDIT 2: Even if I don't find a redditor to live with, I'll definitely be up for a Reddit meet-up!

"Hey, I just saw another post asking about a room and I figured I would post a thread too.  I just moved here a few weeks ago and am looking for a place to live.  I am living with my boss right now and would like to be out by June.  I am 23, musician, working full time, and pretty open to everything. I prefer a quiet home as opposed to a 'bring the party home' type place (I lived in NYC for almost 6 years and I had some pretty terrible experiences).  Let me know if you know of anything.Thanks",Looking for a room,"Looking for a room Hey, I just saw another post asking about a room and I figured I would post a thread too.

"A little background on this question. I'm moving from Chicago to Singapore in a couple of months and I will be staying for roughly 2 to 3 years.

Do any of you gamers experience significant lag or drop offs in connection in anyway?

I've never been to Singapore (or any country in Asia) and I really don't know what to expect. What should I do while I'm there? What will life be like as an American abroad in the country? What will help me get adjusted the most?I'm also having a tough time figuring out how cell phone stuff. I'm on Verizon here so my phone won't work over there (CDMA vs. GSM).
