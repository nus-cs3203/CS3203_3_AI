But after the tenth day, I realised my number still wasn't ported. I made a call to them regarding this and they gave the silly excuse that they're undergoing some system upgrade/maintainence. So I waited and waited. Finally they sent me a text saying that my number has been ported successfully. Problem solved? Not quite.I found out that I could make outgoing calls and send outgoing text. But neither incoming calls nor text are working for me. It's been 7 days and counting that I'm living with this problem.Their customer service has been giving me the run around; Each time I gave them a call, their response is always one of these: 1)We would check on the problem and give you a call back, which they never did. 2) We have resetted your line and it would work in 24hrs. Yea, right, we're still here aren't we.I'm contemplating going down to their service centre to cancel my service with them and return the phone for a full refund. I have been with Singtel and M1 and I have to say, this is really, really atrocious. How could you let your customer not be contactable for a week and blame all this on system upgrades?

I have a couple of questions which I hope some of you may be able to answer.* My results are 1 point worse than the cut-off for my desired JC, what are my chances of making it in if I appeal?* What are the following schools like in terms of environment, teachers and curriculum:    1. Meridian JC    2. Nanyang JC    3. Catholic JC    4. Millennia Institute* Are certain polys well known for certain courses (i.e. Business or Engineering) and if so, what are they?Thanks.",JAE 2011,5,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f0sst/jae_2011/,,"|Don't consider Poly unless you really know what you want to do. It's a VERY competitive environment, and a common prerequisite to score well is to have interest in the course in the first place. Business &amp; Engineering are two very different things. If you're deciding between the both of them, I suggest you enter JC instead. I come from Poly, can't advise on JC stuff.|Man, I wish I could help you, but I took my 'O' levels 14 years ago, and when I entered ACJC the cutoff L1R5 for ACJC Science was 12 points. I don't think that's going to get you into ACJC Arts today (Arts cutoff was 17 points in my day).|I've heard good things about Nanyang JC. My advice would be to check what the consequences of appealing are (price, ability of grade to be lowered etc). If you do appeal, talk to your subject teacher for their advice and act accordingly. Just my opinion, although i'm not really sure how the local system works. |I hope this reaches you in time.JCs are equally as competitive as Polys. No matter what you do, you have to first have already considered if you want a university education in Singapore. Local unis require you to score 80++ out of the max of 90 for you to get into a ""good course"".Before you embark on your route to JC, http://forum.brightsparks.com.sg/showthread.php?t=4226I think it's important to first keep the end in mind. (refer to link above)You may not need to know how a JC works right now, but you should only go to a poly if you REALLY know what you see yourself doing in the future. Don't just apply to Aerospace Engineering or Hospitality just because your friends are doing it. Just saying.To answer your questions:1) 1 point off is as good as completely missing the mark, unless you have some guanxi to pull strings, you're better off with another school in your first choice.2) I personally come from Meridian JC, and as much as my experience was phenomenal, it boils down to preference. All JCs offer the same courses to varying degrees of effectiveness, you just gotta keep in mind: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. The amount of time less spent on travelling gives you more time to rest, play, and study. Especially in a JC where time is short.3) I am pretty sure of a few things: SP has great engin. courses, TP for their business, NP for mass comm. There may be differences in the others' opinions but that's what I've heard all the while. Some polys do not offer the same course that another would offer. So choose carefully if you do.TL;DR, pre-tertiary education is tough, want a quick route to the university? Choose JC. Wanna hit jobstreet asap? Go Poly. Whatever you do, make your time count.|I'm probably too late for this, but i'll try a shot in the dark. The most compelling reason choosing between JC and poly is really the consideration of an eventual tertiary education. Yes, both choices offer a route to the govt sponsored universities in Singapore, but that is based on the level of how far you're willing to work your ass off to secure your future in terms of acquiring the proper accolades and certificates. Consider the base difference between a JC and Poly. One offers an A'level certificate, whilst the other, a diploma. A'levels certs, to my knowledge, are almost close to useless when applying for jobs, as it is not recognised as a standard of expertise. Diplomas on the other hand, are useful in that aspect, and certifies you as a semi-professional in your area of studies.If you do not have a predilection towards diligence when it comes to academia, taking a JC route is a surefire way to screw your life up. The whole point of JC was to prepare you sufficiently for a tertiary education, and if that aim was not achieved, you would've wasted 2 years on a useless piece of paper. These 2 years could've been better used pursuing a diploma, which would've placed you at a better position when you're out looking for jobs. And mind you, this is just getting into tertiary education. The whole ballgame changes when we're talking into getting you into tertiary education, and INTO the course that you're willing to pursue. The hottest courses in local universities are in a state of constant competition. Bidding modules is the norm, and to make the most out of your 3-4 years in a tertiary education, having good results from your A'levels will go a long way. IF you decide the JC route, and managed to get into Uni, but NOT able to acquire the course that you are interested in, wouldn't that also have been a colossal waste of time? The worst case scenario is that you barely made the cutoff into tertiary education, and hence only had a limited number of courses to choose from, and all of them are those fringe outliers that hardly anybody take an interest in. Is that what you want?So, when you do make a choice eventually. Do yourself a favour, sit down, and decide your level of commitment to yourself. If you lack faith in your ability to persevere for the next 5-6 years of your education, getting a diploma would be a much safer bet. If you do excel in poly, there's always a chance you can enter university from there, taking only an extra year in the process.  If you are sincere about endeavoring for your future, then take on JC, as it's the quickest route to universities, to a degree, and to a position where you're armed with the proper accolades to better plan ahead for your future.Once all these are considered, the rest are secondary. Having the commitment to study will ensure that you will excel anywhere, so my recommendation is that you pick the nearest available JC/Poly. Evey other choice boils down to luck, what works for other people won't work the same way for you. Your friends in JC/Poly will determine the eventual experience, much more so than the academia. All in all, it can be the best years of your life, or it could be the worst, there's nothing you can do about it, at least, not right now. Hope this helps.**Edit:** (taking into account that tertiary level is a government sponsored university and not one of the multitude of foreign universities that's only affordable by the upper middle classes of Singapore)"

Like before, I have a couple of questions I hope some of you might be able to help me with.I feel fairly confident that I will be able to make it into a JC. So now, I need help with choosing my subjects. I've already decided on my 3 H2 subjects: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. But I'm still torn between H2 English Language and Linguistics, H1 Economics and H1/H2 Geography as my 4th subject. I've also contemplated taking up H2 Knowledge and Inquiry in place of the General Paper.* Linguistics - I like to read, but I'm not very interested in the emotional side of Literature, analysing how a poem or prose makes you feel. I am, however, interested in the more objective analysis of the language. Truth be told, one of the reasons I've thought about taking this subject was to become a better Grammar Nazi. One who knows for sure what he is talking about as opposed to merely going off his gut feel.* Economics - I don't intend on furthering my studies in this field, but I feel that a basic foundation in Econs would be useful in practical life in the future. I'm also mildy interested in how the Market works.* Geography - I took Geography at the 'O'-levels but didn't do terribly well (B3). I quite liked certain topics, such as Natural Vegetation and Development, but not so much the rest. H1 Geog has Plate Tectonics, which I didn't like at the 'O's, as well as Globalisation, Hydrologic Processes and Urban Issues, which I'm quite fine with. H2 Geog has all that H1 Geog has in addition to Atmospheric Processes and Population Issues, both of which I think I would be quite happy to learn.* Knowledge and Inquiry - Seems to deal with the nature of knowledge and analysis of arguments. I don't know much about this subject and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light.I'm also hoping to get some insight from someone who has taken 4 H2 subjects on what the work load is like, whether it's worth it and what the grading system is like.Thanks.",JC subject combinations,3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f8hn9/jc_subject_combinations/,,"|4 H2 subjects managable.

I'm further guessing that you haven't picked your subjects/can change them so maybe this will be helpful. (even 1 week late)4H2s is definitely doable with slightly more effort. People who pick 4h2s tend to be able to get good marks. I don't really know what you mean by worth it though. ELL is apparently nightmarish for the people who take it, they do lots of sentence analysis and other close analysis type things. Although loads of the people who do ELL get ELL scholarships. The teacher for Econs will tell you that it's one of the hardest subjects to score. It has similarities to Geog type answering, but with a lot and a lot of memorisation. They don't want any purely memorised stuff either, so you have to evaluate and synthesis etc. Apparently, Geography has a lot more analysis at the A levels. I don't know about the syllabus. KI. It's the philosophy subject. Write loads of essays and think in depth and analyse. idk what else you what to know.|Don't know how relevant this will still be. Took KI (A levels last year). It's a difficult subject, and one bad thing is that unless you take another H3/H1 you'll have one less AU than your other 4H2 friends if you didn't take GP. Critical thinking is a focus, but to contradict what diiuuu said, logic is not a main component, it's just 1 section. Philosophy (or more specifically epistemology) is the main focus, though what I would say is the main problem with the subject is that no one actually knows what it's really about, the syllabus that is. We never actually touch on half the questions in quite a few past year papers, and I don't believe it's a problem with the teachers / JCs. The Independent study will be difficult, and afaik, there isn't any bell curve (I'll leave it up to figure out whether this is a good thing for you). Don't let philosophy intimidate you, syllabus wise, it's a watered down version of philosophy, and it's basically a harder version of IB's THeory of Knowledge. People do try to aim higher though, and we've been pushing the standards IMO. Is it an easy subject? No. Is it a rewarding subject? I think so. Would I, all practical considerations considered, recommend it? Probably not. EDIT: Ok appears I have veered off topic, but yeah 4 H2s is definitely manageable. Take it from a senior, DON'T BE COMPLACENT just because I said this, but don't panic too much because everything will fall into place gradually as you get closer to A levels. Honest! ;)"

,1298453492,7,,t3_fqxrk,,7,3,"My fellow Singapore based males,This is a small rant focused on a certain percentage of you. It appears that unlike some of you, I am a master at urinating - the Yoda of Urination if you will. Why do I say this? Because I can stand at the correct distance from the urinal and ensure that I do not cover the porcelain, the floor, the wall and everything else in my urine. And I can do this EVERYTIME.Now I understand that we all come in different shapes and size. Some of us are tall, some of us are short, but I refuse to believe that the distance between the urethra and the final location of your urine will vary to any great extent.Yet I still find my office toilet, public toilets and even private toilets at upscale establishments covered in urine. Therefore I am led to believe that there is in fact a discrepancy between the distance of the urethra and the final destination. Furthermore I can only assume that many of you who commit this foul and unhygienic act have weak streams. As such the slight breeze from the air conditioning system may cause this weak stream to blow off course. A simple solution to this is to stand as close to the urinal as humanly possible. Another solution would be to train the weak PC muscles, the potential culprits behind your weak streams, with some Kegels exercises. These two potential solutions will lead to a far more pleasant experience for everyone involved.Whilst you may not mind your own urine soaking every last inch of the bathroom, others do (crazy I know!  Who wouldn't want to gallivant in your steaming liquid waste?). Be a man and piss in the right place. Also wash your hands, there is such a thing as splash back and the argument ""my penis is the cleanest part of me"" just doesn't fly.Also check your fly, no one needs to see the flag at half mast.

Three new art schools and a massive investment in design studios for instance.The obvious advantage is that such industries can flourish in a space constrained country such as Singapore.

Sometimes, I observe the dancers there practicing their moves. I see a lot of hard work and dedication in their efforts. What I don't see is conviction. Or originality. Their dance moves are perfect technically but they look false and pretentious and mechanical. As an outsider, I feel that Singapore is refusing to get inspired from within. Art is often born inside and gets inspiration from one's cultural heritage. Singaporean artists, I think, are struggling with an identity crisis that's stopping them from drawing inspiration from their own cultural roots. Instead, they are trying too hard to ape the west and failing miserably. Some of the best artists, poets, writers, musicians have lived in abject conditions or have gone through phases of extreme personal crisis. Yet they emerged out even better as artists from these experiences. |I'm coming in a a bit late but let me just chip in to the discussion.I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with [Marslow's Hierarchy of Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). Society goes through different stages (yes yes Marxism blah blah blah): from the developing economy with a citizenry of primarily lower class inhabitants seeking to fulfill basic needs of subsistence up to the developed, rich states with a strong welfare system or where the majority of citizens are well-off enough to contemplate the ostentatious rather than the essentials.Singapore has arguably gone through that cycle in the span of slightly more than a generation; it will be a tall order for the generation who grew up in the 60s and 70s to expect their children to abandon their beliefs of self-enrichment through economic wealth for self-actualisation. I know I am hopelessly simplifying things here but I hope you get my point that it is difficult to change society's notion regarding the importance of art in the span of one or two generations.The current generation who grew up in the late 90s are increasingly seeking self-actualisation as their basic needs are assured and taken care of. Hence the demand for more art schools like SOTA or degree courses in art like those at NTU's ADM. This current generation will need time to mature artistically, and in turn expose society to notions of self-actualisation, beyond just fulfilling material needs, wants and desires. Artists are rare in the older generation. Pioneers like Liu Kang or Ng Eng Teng belong to the pre-independence generation, and many of them come from well-to-do families who can afford their overseas art education. Note the dearth of prominent artists in their 50s and 60s, basically those who grew up during the independence period and during the time when Singapore was struggling to develop its economy and feed its citizens. And in recent times there is the young crop of artists in their 20s and 30s, brought up in the 80s and 90s when Singapore's main populace entered the middle class. There is a strong co-relation between the growth of the culture scene and the economic health of the nation.|talent is inborn and not acquired from force feeding education down our throatsthe latter is how we learn in singapore|Unfortunately, a career in art remains a relatively huge risk and a poor career choice overall, and is thus not encouraged unless someone shows fantastic talent from young or something. With the high costs of living and the lack of a social security net, it is simply not feaaible to take such a risk. |Also a bit late to the conversation, but here're my two cents anyway. It's a complex issue, but one well worth discussing.One of the biggest problems about art in Singapore is the fact that so many things are censored - the eternal question of freedom of speech and lack thereof here. Someone (I can't remember now who and may well be mangling the quote...) once said, ""Art is all the things you don't talk about at the dinner table with polite company: sex, politics and religion."" Subjects, which, as those who have lived here long enough to know, are taboo. Look at the Straits Times, mouthpiece of the nation. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;It's not just about [getting inspired from within as selfish_jean said](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv07m/why_there_are_no_artists_in_singapore/c1iwsg0) or that it's [""an emergent sociological phenomenon that is highly dependent on culture""](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv07m/why_there_are_no_artists_in_singapore/c1itlry), but definitely more of what [tuxedodiplomat said, i.e., ""cannot be dictated top-down""](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv07m/why_there_are_no_artists_in_singapore/c1itprq), although [culture and identity](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fv07m/why_there_are_no_artists_in_singapore/c1iy3et) are an intricate part of the equation.What we have here, on the one hand, is that artists' hands are quite tied by what they can or cannot discuss. This, in my opinion, takes away a lot of depth in Singaporean art, which becomes, as a result, all gloss and no substance. Eye-candy, easily consumed. Is this a good thing? Most would say not.Or maybe it is, because it disseminates art to a wider audience, and what is art if not something people ‚Äî anyone! ‚Äî can identify with? Maybe this is something Singaporean culture has to go through, maybe this is what helps to define its identity. Before good, thought-provoking art can be made, we need to know what the rules are, then and only then can we demolish them. On the other hand, I for one can see how this might give rise to an undercurrent that attempts to find creative ways to circumvent the restrictions, and if so, all the better. I wouldn't know for sure, but I suspect it might be so. I know a lot of people who are dissatisfied with the status quo, and this is especially true for the generations that grew up from the 80s onwards. And in this case, I would say hooray for the government's attempts at pumping money into the art scene, because they may think they know what they're trying to control, but if humanity proves me right, then there will be ways and means to develop and create something that was never dreamt of before.Oh my, how optimistic I sound. But really, I just wanted to say that there *are* artists in Singapore. They're hidden in the nooks and crannies of dusty, dingy shophouses and in the outskirts and in the ""heartlands"", a lot of the times arm in arm with foreigners (lament that as you will or no), but you can find them if you look hard enough."

It's the rent that will kill you (as you have probably learned by now). Good luck! :)|Hi,I work for a start-up company (or used to work) that was acquired by a MNC, and companies like mine used to hire interns a lot of time.1. Most of the guys here are correct in terms of expenses - 600SGD for a room in a HDB apartment, 500 SGD/month for food, transport is cheap &lt;100SGD2. Yes it's safe 3. If you're an intern, you are not going to earn more than SGD 1000, this is because conceptually, interns in Singapore are non-graduates who work 3-4 months, and most corporations take them in as a favor to the universities. The average monthly renumeration we gave was between 6 to 8 hundred SGD a month for the start-up I worked for, but frankly if I was an intern I would take that rather than an offer an large company might make. It's much more rewarding doing something useful in a start-up and mixing around with people your age than interning as a data entry clerk. How long do you intend to stay in Singapore for? Don't want to be a wet blanket, but if its a temporary stay, and you want to use your web design skills, you have to intern in a startup company and not expect more than 800 bucks a month. Alternatively, if you have work experience or startup experience, you can act as a freelance developer! The start-up community in Singapore is pretty tightly knit, with people knowing each other. The Local University NUS itself is a base for many of the startups. Echelon 2011 (most countries call theirs ""unconference"") is in mid June and you can meet a lot of start ups and opportunities."

Wednesday night is Ladies' Night and girls get in for free at most of the big places downtown and get free drinks.There is a place on Clark Quay called Homeclub that I went a few times  - they have pretty good house type music and it's a chill atmosphere. There is a bar/restaurant complex called Chijmes (near the Raffles sort of) that has a free flow night on Wednesdays from 9-11:30 I think, for 20 SGD if I recall. The free flow is at a bar in the complex called La Baroque. If you're into mountain biking, it's pretty easy to get to Pulau Ubin, an island near the main island.

I disagree when people say Singapore is boring. I hear it mostly from people who move around in their circles or have very few interests.

I usually try and have a conversation with the cab drivers - gives you a lot of insight into the real life here.Food: My recommendation is to try out the hawker centres and foodie places that Singaporeans go to. Singaporeans love eating and I can tell you from experience that the food vareity can be overwhelming for such a small place.Clubs, hangouts: clark quay, boat quay is mostly for the clubbing yuppie who dosent care what music is playing. If you are into a specific sort of music, I suggest you look away from these places. There are some hidden gems tucked away which are awesome.Things to do: MacRitchie: great for a jog especially when its drizzling. National Library: you can easily spend a few hours there.

I think it's primarily a matter of what you enjoy. If your idea of fun is getting completely smashed and high, or getting up to general mischief, Singapore is probably going to be as fun as calculus homework for you (I don't know about you, but I hated math with a passion in high school). You're probably aware of this already, but the laws are extremely strict about drugs here.Personally I see Singapore as being great for 4 things; shopping, nature, food, and culture. Shopping is obvious; there's no end to places where you can go around and buy things, from Orchard Road to Little India/Arab Street to all the other places they've listed on the tourist maps you can find at Changi Airport upon arrival. Nature might not be too obvious; if you're into taking walks and/or getting into touch with nature, there's a number of great places: MacRitchie Reservoir, Sungei Buloh National Park, Bukit Timah Hill, Pulau Ubin (an island, great for cycling day-trips ‚Äì there are ferries going to and fro, takes about 15 mins), and Henderson Wave. As for food, if you're into trying local fare, I suggest you grab a copy of Makansutra (local foodie guidebook) at a bookstore and go around trying stuff. And finally, culture ‚Äì surprisingly, Singapore has a small but brilliant theatre scene (companies like Wild Rice, The Necessary Stage, and Cake Theatre, to name a few), and most of their shows are well worth going to.Being an ex-metalhead, I can testify to the general lack of proper metal/rock venues around here. Peninsula Plaza, which is sort of attached to the Peninsula Excelsior Hotel on Coleman St, has a number of shops that cater to the indie/metal/rock demographic ‚Äì CD shops that deal exclusively in metal, metal-related shirt shops, shops that sell records, etc. The market is pitifully small, though, so some of them might have gone out of business since the last time I went there (about a year and a half ago). As for actual venues, there used to be one or two places, but most of them have closed down due to lack of interest/business.Having said that though, Singapore has a knack for bringing in some decent acts over the years (Mayhem in 2006, Dream Theatre in 2006, Sabbat in 2007, Dream Theatre again in 2008, Motley Crue in 2008, Nine Inch Nails in 2009, and this year, Iron Maiden ‚Äì I believe Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Michael Jackson came to Singapore at some point, either when I wasn't born yet or too young to appreciate good music.). You can find out about the more underground concerts at forums like [www.soft.com.sg](http://www.soft.com.sg).Hope that helps a bit. :)EDIT: Fixed URL formatting.

your mother horse,1301116470,7,,t3_gbs7r,,19,13,,an open letter to singaporeans,20,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpj4rmX48G4,,"|So let me get this straight, by not voting PAP we will have less foreigners and cheaper HDB flats? On the issue of foreigners, I don't see what's wrong. If you were to go to another country, you will feel that it is unfair if there is unequal job opportunity yet we are here trying to 'protect' ourselves. If you want to protect yourself, ensure that you have the skills and attitude to do so. Removing foreigners is a false defense mechanism, if Singaporeans don't actively improve what they can offer to employers, they will still lose their jobs to outsourcing and offshoring. Also, discrimination is sign of lack of intelligence, which this video embodies.On the second part though, I agree that it is a problem to open up the housing markets, thereby increasing the prices. However, do not forget that it is partly foreign demand and investment that drives the sector forward. It is a delicate balance and not a simple case of driving foreigners out and reducing prices. Are we that simple-minded?Perhaps this is a cultural thing; in other countries, people are used to moving out of their parents place and renting an apartment. However, we need to get married and buy our first flat as the first milestone which puts considerable strain on our young adults. I can't say for sure which model is better, but as Singapore and the rest of the world globalizes further, expect changes. |Also, what's with the super dramatic music? Wow, it sure feels like the end of the world! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;|Problem is foreigners are not just white collar workers but also those folks that clean houses, build buildings, dig ditches, sweep streets - I can't see any local Chinese folks stooping so low to do hard work. So Singapore is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It wants foreign talent into the country to both boost its productivity AND clean and build things, but it can't do it with out bringing out the xenophobia of the local populous. What to do, what to do?|I don't quite agree with some of the points - esp the foreigners. You can't have the infrastructure and not have the needed menial workers to support.Sure I'm pissed that public transportation has gone the way of hell, where you can't even get on the train, but removing foreigners isn't the solution.That said, a target population of 6.5m is insane given our land space. Our public transportation system can barely handle it as it is, especially the popular MRT stations. I don't have any solutions for this; the only one I can think of is a quota system, and an additional levy if a company would hire foreign workers. It's the same system used in other countries, you must really need their expertise before you commit to hiring.Of course, this solution goes against my first point of menial workers, but a minimal wage for menial workers may go a long way in getting more workers. I'm not talking about $16/hr, a reasonable $6-8 dollars would definitely be attractive, no?|Depressing... Even the country with such prestige in the world wants to start from scratch again...|Yes, cheaper HDB flats but rent market will crash too. So many native and third generation foreigners in Singapore get by easily just from fetching rents from multiple properties.|FYIWDWYTM"

So we edited it for sense, i.e., underscoring a positive feeling (heartwarming) with a positive fact; rather than the self-penned irony of a positive feeling (heartwarming) backed by a negative fact (90% failure rate to university admission by less well off children). That was why we replaced the original statistic with the only one in Ms Chang‚Äôs March 8 report that matched your elation, that is, that 50 percent of less well off children found tertiary success.",ST forum trolls troll.,13,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gf84b/st_forum_trolls_troll/,,"|tl dr; Reader writes in with sarcastic letter 'praising' education system.

Because I am a graduate from a reasonable university, I can get a working holiday visa, which gives me 6 months, and can be extended with sponsorship.  My query essentially boils down to three questions:* first, how difficult would it be for me to find work, and how long would this take, and how much could I hope to earn;* second, how much money should I take with me to get me into said work; and* third, what is it actually like living in Singapore, and where in the city should I live?About myself: I majored in Law and Pols (LLB / BA), I specialised mostly in commercial papers, so am really holding hoping for a job in banking, credit or finance, however, I have no experience in said fields.  I could also try for work in a law firm, but I would not be able to practice without completing the 5 month Professionals course in Singapore, and I imagine this would be very expensive.  I also have an online background, in advertising, having worked (mostly part time) for a major NZ website for four years.  My marks at uni were not great, and hovered around B+ / A- for arts and B+ / B for law.I was kind of on track, and then I read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/edt8b/does_anyone_know_a_good_headhunter_in_singapore/), which says it can take sometimes 6 months to land a job. Any information would be hugely appreciated -- thanks fellers (and sheilas), I love you for it.","Hay guys! I'm moving to Singapore in two months, from New Zealand, and I would dearly love some advice on a few particulars.",11,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ginwo/hay_guys_im_moving_to_singapore_in_two_months/,,"|Firstly,I wish you all the best of luck!I cant help you at all but im sure if you find a single lawyer, he/she'll be able to break it down for you very well. But I can help you with ""what is is like work in singapore, and where in the city"" you should live.Lets start with what you've heard and your most pressing questions.|Might be advisable to send your resumes to prospective employers and try to land an offer before coming over. For a degree holder I reckon the least they could pay you is S$2500 (employment pass criteria). Maybe you could get more but it all depends on your field.The amount of cash you need to bring will depend on where you intend to stay. In a condominium? A room in a shared apartment? Prices will vary depending on location as well. And location is again dependent on your work place. So getting a job offer before arriving is really important. You can go [here](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/) to get a feel of rent and locations. Singapore is a great place to live in. Crime is low. Streets are safe to walk at any time. Great variety of food and restaurants. So long as you don't strip naked and run around drunk and get into fights, life will be just fine. Get to know the locals, while we may look quite sullen, you will be surprised at how good hosts we can be.|1. Can't really help you there, not too sure about those industries sadly.2. Depends on where you wanna live, and how much you wanna spend. Rent can be up to $2k (sing) a month for a big flat, to $800 with utility and internet covered (depending on location).3. Singapore's pretty awesome if you're a fan of food, but I'm not a night life person (used to be, got bored of it after 21 o.O) but there are plenty of night spots. 4. (since your third question is 2 parts) Central areas like AMK, Braddell, are fine for getting to go anywhere, but may be a bit more expensive and harder to find. You could try Tampines/Bedok but those areas tend to get pretty crowded in the mornings when you wanna take a train. Not too sure about the west side though.|If you're going to get a job you're going to need an employment pass. There are a couple of different levels of EP and it depends on your salary that you will be paid. The different levels can be found here: http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/employment-pass/before-you-apply/Pages/default.aspx . Although do take note that the base amount per pass level will be going up in July I think. I'm not sure about P1 or Q1 but I know P2 will be going to $4000/month. If I were you I'd suggest looking at something like a personalised employment pass (PEP) although this does have a few requirements (http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/personalised-employment/before-you-apply/Pages/default.aspx).Regarding money to take with you - it really depends on how you want to live. I am from the UK and maintaining the same life style as I did there is actually a lot more expensive here. Alcohol is pretty pricey here and shopping at the big name supermarkets can be pretty pricey too along with buying 'foreign' goods. As an example I've got a Nespresso coffee machine. The machine in the UK set me back S$240 whereas I saw the same model here at S$600. The thing about Singapore is that eating out can be very cheap. I think you could probably live quite comfortably off S$20 a day for food and that's getting some damn good meals from the hawker centres and food courts. Living in Singapore again really depends on what you want and how much you're willing to pay. If you want the expat life style then renting an apartment can be pretty expensive. A 1 bedroom condo in the Orchard area can set you back about S$3500/month although if you do branch out away from this area then the price can go down by a fair amount. Utilities generally cost me S$400 a month for a 2 bedroom condo including television, internet, gas, electricity and water. But bear in mind that I probably spend at least one week in a month away from Singapore so you'd be looking at maybe a bit more. One thing to note is that when renting condos they also incur a maintenance fee but in most cases this is paid for by the landlord rather than the tenant. I'm not sure how long you intend to stay here but in most cases a contract to lease a place will be in general for 2 years. If you're really unsure then it might be worth looking for any apartment blocks that will be going to en bloc (this is when they're going to get knocked down and a new one will be developed in place). Generally the rent for these can be a lot cheaper. My cousin had a 1500sqft 2 bedroom condo in the Orchard area for which he was paying S$3000/month. The only problem was that he had 6 months to live there and then that was it - there was no possibility to extend so he had 6 months of cheap rental and then had to scramble to find other living arrangements.I hope this helps OP - let me know if you want any other info!|1. I think you should focus on using your four-year online background in advertising rather than hoping to land a job in a law firm. I think this raises your chances significantly as more and more companies look for experienced employees.2. If you're not that picky with rooms you can get one and share the whole flat with other people. Just don't get one anywhere near CBD, the rent will zap your money. I'd say 2.5K at least for your most basic needs is safe, much much more if you want to party or get anything luxurious for yourself.3. I think SG is pretty urban, and very flat itself. There's not much to do around the country. People are pretty much 8-5 workers and usually keeps to themselves only. I'm seeing a couple of post here in reddit SG which is very anti-FT, but if you're a white guy then expect to be treated a bit special. If you're the type of person who isn't bothered by the lack of variety, who's content with just sitting in a coffee shop and browsing reddit, having an social drink or two, and enjoys endurance sports (swim, bike, run, etc.) then you'll be fine. Where in the city to live? My personal preference is on the east side (bedok, changi, simei, pasir ris, punggol). Flats / rooms are reasonably priced and you're a few minutes away from East Coast Park / Changi beach. |haha awesome, not a single ""get out, we're full"" comment|Facebook Singapore is hiring at the moment - you might want to look at that.  most of the other questions have been answered.

,1303803370,3,,t3_gxmas,,3,17,"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home. My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes. For example:1)     She flooded my kitchen ‚Äì  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn‚Äôt). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won‚Äôt happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!2)     She didn‚Äôt close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn‚Äôt apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying ‚ÄúWhat to do, it has happened.‚Äù Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don‚Äôt always want to come back at the end of the day.4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms).  Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are ‚ÄúCommited to Serve‚Äù ‚Äì but I think it is just rhetoric and I don‚Äôt see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn‚Äôt big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors. I have to decide whether to renew my maid‚Äôs 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary. Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance. People say that the devil you know is better than one you don‚Äôt. But I feel that I can‚Äôt tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one?

WGB,1303879219,4,,t3_gyd7o,,0,8,"Since the last General Election in 2006, Singaporeans have seen how social media helped a relatively unknown senator become president of the most powerful country in the world. Singaporeans have also watched as Egypt and Libya underwent political revolution driven by the desire of the people for change. We live in a time of change. We can taste it in the air. We are surrounded by it, we see it happening and we know that it is possible. This General Election will be one with many firsts. As Singaporeans living in a culture obsessed with being first, it is ironic that it has taken us so long to finally reach this stage of political development. For the first time in decades, opposition parties are challenging most of the seats in Parliament. As a result, many Singaporeans will have a chance to vote for the first time in our lives. For the first time in Singapore's history, voters are truly connected with the campaigns process as we utilize social media to report, investigate, question, criticize, defend and support candidates and parties. For the first time, we are active participants, rather than mere observers. The Internet has become the battlefield, and for the first time, we are on the front lines. Elections are the political marketplace of ideas. Good candidates, policies and parties are introduced or retained while those experiencing low demand are weeded out. As a voter, you have a duty to partake in determining the future of your country by participating in this marketplace of ideas. You must decide whether you are willing to buy what the various parties and candidates are trying to sell you. No matter who you vote for or why, it is vital to remember that your vote determines your future, not your past. The past is often a useful indicia to the future, but this does not hold true in periods of change because changed circumstances result in unpredictable outcomes if the existing model does not adapt rapidly and sufficiently. Globalization, the influx of foreign wealth, and the inability of wages to keep up with inflation indicate changed circumstances. As voters, we must vote for whoever we think can deal with these new issues which may have no analogues in the past. Therefore, vote with regard to the future, not the past.Also, do not be afraid to vote with integrity. Rather, be afraid that if you do not and the outcome is not to your liking, it may well be because you forfeited your chance to create a different future. Do not be held hostage by fear or threats that your government will take less care of you because you voted for a different party. A government holds duties to all its citizens equally, and by voting with integrity, you hold your government accountable. Naturally, I expect that everyone who has voted in the past has voted with integrity, otherwise the concept of the ""peoples' mandate"" would be a farce. Nevertheless, this bears reminding. Vote with integrity.Finally, take comfort in the fact that, no matter who wins in the end, if everyone has voted with integrity and in regards to the future, Singapore will have taken a great step forward from ""A Singapore for the people"" to ""A Singapore for the people, by the people"".May the best men and women win.",The duties that accompany change,12,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gyd7o/the_duties_that_accompany_change/,,

Then youcan choose where to spend eternity."" ""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in? heaven,"" says the MP. ""I'm sorry, but we have our rules"", replies St.Peter. And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of agreen golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting richat the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time thatbefore he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. ""Now it's time to visit heaven,"" St Peter says. So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good timeand the 24 hours in heaven passes by and St Peter returns. ""Well, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now which will you choose for your eternity?"" St Peter asks. The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers, ""Well, I never would have thought it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I wouldbe happier and better off .. in hell."" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The Devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ""I don't understand,"" stammers the MP. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drankchampagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"" The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.......Today .. YOU voted.

,1304040289,2,,t3_gzsf3,,8,13,"I realised I can't.  I had already decided I was going to weigh the policies and proposals of the SDP against the PAP. Looking through them, I was torn between the pragmatism of the PAP and the idealism of the SDP. Yet at the same time, caught between the failed promises of the PAP and the naivety of the SDP. It seemed to me my only recourse was to pit the charisma of the ruling party against the enthusiasm of the opposition. I was excited. I got to vote and I got to do it well. Then suddenly a whirl of bad sportsmanship took over with the 'gay video' issue. I was thoroughly disheartened. Not only by the by the lack of grace displayed by the PAP candidates, but also by the way they used the gay issue, weilding it as if it should have anything to do with the elections. My social loyalties were called into question. Nonetheless, I decided to take into account only the way in which the issue was handled as opposed to the issue itself. Afterall, the grace and aplomb in which the opposition reacted to the issue was commendable and while I may have lost faith in one PAP candidate, the subtle chastise that PM Lee slipped into a speech restored my faith in the party as a whole.I was back to thinking objectively. Who did I agree more with? Who did I feel would aid the society more? The opposition candidates seemed strong and motivated, albeit lacking the finesse of the PAP. The PAP riding on it's success seemed confident it could do even more, even if it seemed a little tired. Hurrah for democracy. I got to vote between to parties that seemed equally capable, at least within the constituency. I mean, I do believe the PAP needs to remain in power as a whole, and I have no doubt it will, but for my constituency, I want the best possible party.Then suddenly another hurdle appeared. I was pointed to a video of another ruling party candidate during parliament. It was his address to parliament regarding the 377a issue. Interested in how he might carry himself, I decided to watch only to come away with the sense of unease. His speech did not weigh the practical or pragmatic problems that might arise from the repeal. Instead, it was a bigoted demonisation of the community disguised as a pragmatic discourse. Checking the facts, he lied about his statistics being more thorough regarding the question of whether homosexuality was genetic. I could have looked past this. I told myself I could. It's an wrongly informed opinion that should not affect my vote. But I could not look past what he said next. What he said next was so abhorrent I could hardly believe it came out of his mouth. He claimed that even if homosexuality was genetic, he would not recommend the repeal of the legislature. His reasons of genetic dispostions for kleptomania only fueled the rage within me even more. How could he deny basic rights to people who were born that way? How can someone be so bigoted as to believe that basic rights given to human beings to choose who they want to have sex with can be taken away on the basis of a disorder that is of a comepletely different nature? Could he really not see that whilst kleptomania infringed on someone else's right to ownership, homosexuality infringed on nobody else's rights? Or was this really a clever ploy to discredit the community once more?I have lost faith in objectivity. For the ruling party itself is not willing to remain objective. My heart can no longer allow my mind to consider the credit of candidates whose morals it has a complete disrespect for.tl;dnr: Read it or don't.

That is undeniable. However, please look the reason the government is doing this, instead of just being myopic and look at 1 person's point of view. Please take note of the following points in a larger sense, in Singapore's point at view.Firstly, let's look at the scholarship as a price, and the students as a 'goods'. We are paying (in scholarship) to buy talents (in students) from other countries, paying say 100k, to procure a fully grown student, with high potential to achieve result. There may be some students that leave, and some who simply use Singapore as stepping stone. However, ULTIMATELY, some stay, and they become asset to Singapore's development. Who knows, they may even settle down here. Don't forget, most Singaporeans were once immigrants too. I'm sure the relevant authorities have done enough calibration to ensure maximum opportunity cost, but I don't believe I'm qualified to go into that.Secondly, this does not disadvantage Singaporeans, AS A WHOLE. Do you think that without the foreigners, the MNCs will have no choice but to hire local Singaporeans? Perhaps you have forgotten that as easy as it is for foreigners to leave their countries, it is as easy for the companies to LEAVE SINGAPORE and invest in another country with more talents. Again, there have to be a delicate calibrationLastly, eventually students who settle in Singapore have to work, and they pay tax too. As high paying professional, the tax they'll contribute to Singapore in their term here, or even in their lifetime, if they do stay on, will cover part, if not all of their cost. However I do not deny the fact that there's social discomfort and culture misfit of foreign students when there's large amount of student.

Good job!|I personally don't think that george yeo will lose his job as foreign minister just because he didn't win the GE. On another note though, MM, SM &amp; PM should not participate in the GE because it isn't fair to the opposition. Words they say are generally being taken seriously and strongly publicised in the media."
,1304824926,3,,t3_h6gyk,,19,9,"While the percentages surely reflect that the up-and-coming Opposition put up a good fight, (40+% in most constituencies is no joke), there is no denying that a clear majority would have been most encouraging. I was hoping to hit at least double digits of Opposition in Parliament.The good thing they did, that I appreciate is the fact that they competed independently in most constituencies save one, thus avoiding competition among themselves.However, this may have also hurt them. If every party was in some way fighting for the ""co-driver"" position, knowing for sure that alone they could not form the Parliament, they should have formed a temporary coalition at least this time around, to contest mega-party vs mega-party. The paradox of choice, and the size of the individual parties, may not have won that much confidence. It allowed PAP to deftly play the ""Disadvantages of coalition government"" card too easily. The temporary coalition could have played the ""Unity in Diversity"" card to counter this. That it's ok to have different viewpoints within the same party.Then there's this silent majority? What are the best ways to draw them out? Since establishing that the local new outlets are nothing more than PAP lackeys.I also think that the Opposition plays a bit too much on populist sentiments such as overly harsh criticism of foreign talent, for one thing. It's one thing to recognise the failings of a liberal immigration policy, but it's quite another to effectively demonise an increasingly significant population of the country, some of whom also have citizenships. In future, their kids will have citizenships too, and this population will grow. Of course they wouldn't vote for a party that mandates that it doesn't want them around.And blaming *everything else* on foreigners is a really negative sentiment, that also sends out an ugly image to the rest of the world. Housing prices increase are due to the market-price policy, merely accelerated by but not caused by foreigners.Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of crowded roads in a country where cars are seen as status symbols instead of tools that may be unnecessary. Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of frequencies and regular timings. Even in bigger cities with bigger populations elsewhere in the world, similar metro systmes adopt different techniques to achieve efficiency. More time learning those methods, less time blaming foreigners?And the #1 reason foreigners are preferred, blame the government &amp; its educational policies thus far. Every education policy is geared towards producing overachieving slave drones who're engineered to be good at gaming the system they study in.Even historically, the local universities were set up to supply undergraduates to the growing economy, *not* to educate future industrial leaders. And it shows. Even the University rankings are gamed, and not entirely deserved. Every course offered in University is a course that the local economy looks for, but nothing more.Compare with even a country like China? After their high school examinations the best stay *in* China in local Ivy universities, while the next best get scholarships to go everywhere else in the world. In Singapore, the best are only considered the best if they are educated outside of Singapore.Gtg for now, but hopefully we can continue this?",Discussing the issues brought up this GE 2011.,12,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/h6gyk/discussing_the_issues_brought_up_this_ge_2011/,,"|**Long wall of text**I disagree with your first point on an Opposition coalition to challenge against the PAP. The problem is that many of the parties such like Reform Party and NSP are relatively new, they want to create a brand and name for themselves first. If they had join in a coalition, they would have been completely overshadowed by Worker's Party and SDP. I feel that it is important for the newer parties to fight in this elections and establish themselves. NSP has proved themselves although I felt that they depended too much on Nicole Seah. Reform Party was a bit of a disappointment to me though, but I guess that's due to many people leaving the party.Furthermore, the opposition themselves were advocating for a *multi-party* parliament where different parties can come together and help in the nation-building process. To form a coalition would only appear to the voters that there were two big mega parties and will probably work against the opposition. Sure, it will help the opposition to appear united and who knows, East Coast GRC, Joo Chiat and Pasir Potong might have went to the Opposition. But personally, I feel a coalition is not a good idea. Perhaps the opposition can form a coalition in 2016.As for the silent majority, it's difficult. Some people are really, really political apathetic. To them, a different political party means nothing, the day will go on, Singapore will still be running but with a different political party at the helm. So they'll probably just vote PAP again. It's hard to reach them because they won't actively search out alternative political blogs and forums to discuss about policies. The only way, as Alex Au recently posted on his blog this morning is to actively work the ground, like what WP did.Ah, the big number issue: foreigners. I agree with you that the Opposition played a bit too much with populists sentiments. I thought they nearly crossed the line to a protectionism policy in Singapore. While I'm very, very pissed off at the influx of foreigners, my anger is more directed to the immigration policy. Also, I felt that the Opposition could have gone at PAP's jugular by stating that even though foreigners come to Singapore by the masses, a huge majority of them are underpaid, lack workplace safety and insurance and live in unsanitary conditions. By doing this, it would have pointed straight back to the failures of PAP's immigration policy and their failure to improve the infrastructure to accommodate the massive influx of foreigners.But sometimes, I think why the Opposition parties worked the sentiments of Singaporeans is because during the past five years, when we tried to express our displeasures against certain policies, the PAP dismissed us, saying we don't know anything. That, plus major cock-ups, led to five years of simmering frustrations that boiled over during the elections. It's already hard to talk sense to people during the election period, much more harder if people are very angry.Frankly speaking, I was disappointed with the results. I wanted WP to win East Coast GRC and went I saw that Linda Chiam lost Pontong Pasir, I was very upset. I also hoped that SDP would have won Holland-Bukit Timah. But we can't ask for everything. At least WP gained ground by winning Aljunied GRC.And screw TPL.|This is great! A really great conversation. As someone who grew up in Singapore but who is now disconnected, I do not feel I can contribute to this but I would just like to let it be known that this is some good stuff right here.I would just like to observe the statistics. It seems that besides the winning wards, wards attained ard 35-45% votes which is around the same as 2006. This is both a great thing and a cause for concern.This is great because the opposition has successfully scaled up its efforts to all wards but LKY's. I feared that they were spreading themselves too thin. This is not the case.It is worrying to me because this might be signs of a plateau.The fact that patong pasir was lost only validates my fears, I think. I have not looked at the stats but if wards that were contested in 2006 did not see a surge in 2011 it would seal my suspicions."

TPL will fade away too, eventually, but it will be done at a face-saving pace.I think people should lay off TPL now. The PAP backbencher MPs' role is that of a rubberstamp. Even if the MP has personal objections, they are not allowed to vote against the party, unless the party Whip is lowered, and that has seldom happened. Even then, like in the casino vote, the furthest they push is to abstain from voting, followed by stepping down in the next election.For a rubberstamp, TPL is way overqualified.

However porn sites are blocked in the masses but there are still some to access. As far as connection goes, most things are stateside, so TV shows, and DLC for console games aren't allowed in this region. Usually your ping will be rough, 290-330 for most things, and if you have a routing issue its generally a nightmare to coordinate with your ISP to get it straightened out. My recommendation is that if you really care about your internet connection go Singtel, do not go Starhub.|I don't have any significant problems with it. There are plenty of people who complain about their internet connections online but there also plenty of people who have no problem too.|Get Singtel ADSL or the new fibre network(connected to Singtel). Don't get suckered by Starhub (cable tv), they advertise 100mbps.  I tried it at first and cancelled because I and practically everyone I've spoken with about it can't even watch YouTube videos without stuttering. It also slows down *incredibly* in the evening. The other carriers don't have good connections abroad IMHO.Get a VPN to avoid restrictions  Ping time to the US is 200ms+, so you'll be looking for servers closer to home (sing and Australia).Keep a US credit card handy (with the US based VPN) for buying tunes, videos etc online. E-commerce has not taken off in Singapore.|well, http://www.chick.com is blocked :)connection wise it's pretty damn good i would sayyea, i suggest Singtel too|Here is my take on it coming from the Nordics and having lived here for two years1. Do not use a ISP without significant international presence i.e. Starhub and M1. Singtel is the only option or private business lines 2. Setup a VPN connection 3. Keep US or UK CC for DLC, iTunes etc. I currently use iTunes UK with an Apple TV2 without any problems. Any SD content is watchable instantly over a 15 Mbit/s Singtel ADSL connection. HD takes a bit longer 4. Don't torrent as it is a mark on your employment pass and they do take ""IP"" rights seriously. Btw this included buying cheap DVD's from neighboring countries5. Singtels MioTV sucks and Starhub is the only real option if you watch TV. This may get better during summer due to some big content blocks coming up for grabs. I have chosen to watch less TV as I couldn't be bothered to have both providers6. Singtels Mobile network is better for roaming in the region but M1 could be better globally due to using the Vodacom network (haven't looked at details)7. Trivia, Singtel is bigger then you think with 400 million active mobile subscribersAll in all I'm happy with my connection but there is always some amount of lag due to it being geographically far apart. Especially Europe often being routed over the US.|Don't believe what Starhub says: Fat Green PipeIt's clogged. All. The. Time.But I'm still a Starhub user, god damn discounts and free gifts.|M1, 100mbs fiber optic, $40sgd.|For PC Gaming, there are local servers for FPS games. Check www.fragnetics.com I usually play on their BFBC2 servers. Locally hosted so pings are 30-70.I'm currently on a 15mbps DSL connection with Singnet. It is bundled with crappy TV (Mio TV), a landline for SGD $60 a month.I torrent and game on it to my hearts content. No point in going with Fiber yet as international downloads can only max out at 15mbps while local content is up to 100mbps. But there really is no local content to speak of so there is no point in getting an expensive Fiber plan.|Bit torrent and P2P traffic is throttled by the use of packet shapers.No real way to circumvent this short of using an external VPN outside Singapore.|my signet is laggy during evening times when playing CS:S..

Any thing specific that you want answers on?|I'm currently an NUS student. You shouldn't expect everyday folk outside of NUS to behave/speak/interact in a similar way with those you work with in NUS. Asian societies tend to have a broad variety of demographic groups across their population which make for a very diverse environment. If you don't speak Chinese or Malay or Tamil you will not be able to communicate with the full spectrum of the population. But if you're only going to be here for 2 months then I reckon there's no pressing need to.Don't be alarmed though, English is still the lingua franca albeit in a colloquialised form of what is known as Singlish.

I don't really know what MA is like in the summer, but I can guarantee you it's at least as hot and twice as humid here.I have a Verizon Blackberry that I use both in Singapore and the US. I had Verizon unlock it for me over the phone (you just need to call them and tell them you're going overseas, that worked for me... and be very firm about refusing any roaming plans and etc.) However, because I don't think your Droid has a SIM card, you probably won't be able to get it unlocked for use here. Your plan with bringing the Droid sounds good. Smartphones are going to be expensive if you aren't getting a plan (equivalent to contracts in the US).Life will be different, but not drastically. Singapore is actually becoming relatively Westernised, depending on where you go. Almost everyone understands English to some extent, with the majority being fluent. You'll still be able to get a good burger. The public transportation system is excellent. I don't know exactly where you are in Jurong, but I would actually argue that the train system will get you to NUS faster, especially with rush hour traffic. You'll have no problem navigating the train system if you're familiar with the T in Boston. The buses are also pretty efficient. As previously mentioned, http://gothere.sg will help a lot with navigation, but there is also pretty good signage at each bus stop. Cabs are cheap compared to what I've experienced in the US.As for what will help you get adjusted the most - just come with as open a mind as possible. People might be a little unfriendly compared to what you're used to in the US. In my experience, Americans are more likely to strike up conversation with a stranger, they're more effusive and chatty, etc. Singaporeans may take longer to initiate conversation, or be generally quieter and more aloof. However, they mean well. Any coldness you experience is more likely just uncertainty on how to make conversation with you, since you're from a pretty different place. Don't be offended. Try the food, but be prepared not to like all of it, just by virtue of its diversity.I'll stop here, just because this is getting really lengthy, but let me know if I can help with anything else.EDIT: Oh yeah, make sure you bring adapters for your electronics, because the electrical outlets are different here.
