,Preparing For A.C.M.E II and FAQs
"I had recently switched to Starhub from Singtel. I was ok with the fact that they told me that they would port my number in 7-10 days. But after the tenth day, I realised my number still wasn't ported. I made a call to them regarding this and they gave the silly excuse that they're undergoing some system upgrade/maintainence. So I waited and waited. Finally they sent me a text saying that my number has been ported successfully. Problem solved? Not quite.I found out that I could make outgoing calls and send outgoing text. But neither incoming calls nor text are working for me. It's been 7 days and counting that I'm living with this problem.Their customer service has been giving me the run around; Each time I gave them a call, their response is always one of these: 1)We would check on the problem and give you a call back, which they never did. 2) We have resetted your line and it would work in 24hrs. Yea, right, we're still here aren't we.I'm contemplating going down to their service centre to cancel my service with them and return the phone for a full refund. I have been with Singtel and M1 and I have to say, this is really, really atrocious. How could you let your customer not be contactable for a week and blame all this on system upgrades? I really think some thing is wrong with their customer service and I don't think I will ever use them nor will I recommend them to my family and friends. Not after I describe to them my ordeal.What a nightmare!",Switching to Starhub was a big mistake.

But I'm still torn between H2 English Language and Linguistics, H1 Economics and H1/H2 Geography as my 4th subject. I've also contemplated taking up H2 Knowledge and Inquiry in place of the General Paper.* Linguistics - I like to read, but I'm not very interested in the emotional side of Literature, analysing how a poem or prose makes you feel. I am, however, interested in the more objective analysis of the language. Truth be told, one of the reasons I've thought about taking this subject was to become a better Grammar Nazi. One who knows for sure what he is talking about as opposed to merely going off his gut feel.* Economics - I don't intend on furthering my studies in this field, but I feel that a basic foundation in Econs would be useful in practical life in the future. I'm also mildy interested in how the Market works.* Geography - I took Geography at the 'O'-levels but didn't do terribly well (B3). I quite liked certain topics, such as Natural Vegetation and Development, but not so much the rest. H1 Geog has Plate Tectonics, which I didn't like at the 'O's, as well as Globalisation, Hydrologic Processes and Urban Issues, which I'm quite fine with. H2 Geog has all that H1 Geog has in addition to Atmospheric Processes and Population Issues, both of which I think I would be quite happy to learn.* Knowledge and Inquiry - Seems to deal with the nature of knowledge and analysis of arguments. I don't know much about this subject and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light.I'm also hoping to get some insight from someone who has taken 4 H2 subjects on what the work load is like, whether it's worth it and what the grading system is like.Thanks.",JC subject combinations

"My fellow Singapore based males,This is a small rant focused on a certain percentage of you. It appears that unlike some of you, I am a master at urinating - the Yoda of Urination if you will. Why do I say this? Because I can stand at the correct distance from the urinal and ensure that I do not cover the porcelain, the floor, the wall and everything else in my urine. And I can do this EVERYTIME.Now I understand that we all come in different shapes and size. Some of us are tall, some of us are short, but I refuse to believe that the distance between the urethra and the final location of your urine will vary to any great extent.Yet I still find my office toilet, public toilets and even private toilets at upscale establishments covered in urine. Therefore I am led to believe that there is in fact a discrepancy between the distance of the urethra and the final destination. Furthermore I can only assume that many of you who commit this foul and unhygienic act have weak streams. As such the slight breeze from the air conditioning system may cause this weak stream to blow off course. A simple solution to this is to stand as close to the urinal as humanly possible. Another solution would be to train the weak PC muscles, the potential culprits behind your weak streams, with some Kegels exercises. These two potential solutions will lead to a far more pleasant experience for everyone involved.Whilst you may not mind your own urine soaking every last inch of the bathroom, others do (crazy I know!  Who wouldn't want to gallivant in your steaming liquid waste?). Be a man and piss in the right place. Also wash your hands, there is such a thing as splash back and the argument ""my penis is the cleanest part of me"" just doesn't fly.Also check your fly, no one needs to see the flag at half mast. Edit: Please find attached an [image](http://i.imgur.com/rcWbF.png) to help illustrate right and wrong ",Stop pissing about!!!

First, it was contradictory and didn‚Äôt make sense.Your original sentence cannot mean what it says unless you were elated over the fact that nine in 10 children from less well-off homes failed to qualify for university. So we edited it for sense, i.e., underscoring a positive feeling (heartwarming) with a positive fact; rather than the self-penned irony of a positive feeling (heartwarming) backed by a negative fact (90% failure rate to university admission by less well off children). That was why we replaced the original statistic with the only one in Ms Chang‚Äôs March 8 report that matched your elation, that is, that 50 percent of less well off children found tertiary success.",ST forum trolls troll.

"So, I have just finished studying (in November), I just spent spent five months in America, and now I have booked some flights to Singapore where I hope to live and work for 6 months, and maybe even a year or two. Because I am a graduate from a reasonable university, I can get a working holiday visa, which gives me 6 months, and can be extended with sponsorship.  My query essentially boils down to three questions:* first, how difficult would it be for me to find work, and how long would this take, and how much could I hope to earn;* second, how much money should I take with me to get me into said work; and* third, what is it actually like living in Singapore, and where in the city should I live?About myself: I majored in Law and Pols (LLB / BA), I specialised mostly in commercial papers, so am really holding hoping for a job in banking, credit or finance, however, I have no experience in said fields.  I could also try for work in a law firm, but I would not be able to practice without completing the 5 month Professionals course in Singapore, and I imagine this would be very expensive.  I also have an online background, in advertising, having worked (mostly part time) for a major NZ website for four years.  My marks at uni were not great, and hovered around B+ / A- for arts and B+ / B for law.I was kind of on track, and then I read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/edt8b/does_anyone_know_a_good_headhunter_in_singapore/), which says it can take sometimes 6 months to land a job.

"There are a LOT of things I could discuss about that Q&amp;A to outline the further intellectual and moral degradation and dissonance of the PAP.But what struck me as most ridiculous was when PM Lee mentioned PAP in a non-PAP constituency wondering (not verbatim) ""why should I be working so hard for people who aren't happy with my work?""This mirrors SM Goh's comment to that NTU student last year:&gt;""Why should I be working for people who don‚Äôt feel they belong over here?""Excuse me, but what happened to politicians being there to *serve* citizens?

And our government has most certainly established a monopoly, one that is still behind a smokescreen of false power words such as ""republic"" and ""democratic"". They've bullied, prosecuted, and bankrupted the opposition, and now they claim that we shouldn't choose anyone but the sensationalist demagogues at PAP, who warn of terrible things to come if another party is elected to power.As if the Singaporean population as a whole is too dim-witted to choose what is best for themselves through a *democratic* election (although that word is really just become a bit of a joke around here).Meanwhile, as they claim to be fighting for our us, they grow fat on ridiculous salaries and mindboggling pension plans. A pension that awards them 70% of their salary! And let me remind you that our MPs each draw over S$200,000 a year. $S140,000 a year once they retire just seems ridiculous. And don't even get me started on our PM, SM, and MM's S$3.7 million.And they have the **audacity** to ask why they should work hard for people that aren't happy with their work? I think S$3.7 million in taxpayer money is more than enough incentive to work hard. Who knows, they might even make a half-hearted attempt to actually figure out why people are started to express dissatisfaction at how they're leading the country.Apologies for being so long winded. That turned out a lot longer and more cathartic than I intended.**TL;DR Singapore's politicians are imbeciles.**Now I sit back and wait to be served papers on the grounds of defamation.",After watching the PM Q&amp;A...

"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home. My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes. For example:1)     She flooded my kitchen ‚Äì  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn‚Äôt). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won‚Äôt happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!2)     She didn‚Äôt close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn‚Äôt apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying ‚ÄúWhat to do, it has happened.‚Äù Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don‚Äôt always want to come back at the end of the day.4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms).  Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are ‚ÄúCommited to Serve‚Äù ‚Äì but I think it is just rhetoric and I don‚Äôt see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn‚Äôt big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors. I have to decide whether to renew my maid‚Äôs 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary. Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance. People say that the devil you know is better than one you don‚Äôt. But I feel that I can‚Äôt tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one?

"Since the last General Election in 2006, Singaporeans have seen how social media helped a relatively unknown senator become president of the most powerful country in the world. Singaporeans have also watched as Egypt and Libya underwent political revolution driven by the desire of the people for change. We live in a time of change. We can taste it in the air. We are surrounded by it, we see it happening and we know that it is possible. This General Election will be one with many firsts. As Singaporeans living in a culture obsessed with being first, it is ironic that it has taken us so long to finally reach this stage of political development. For the first time in decades, opposition parties are challenging most of the seats in Parliament. As a result, many Singaporeans will have a chance to vote for the first time in our lives. For the first time in Singapore's history, voters are truly connected with the campaigns process as we utilize social media to report, investigate, question, criticize, defend and support candidates and parties. For the first time, we are active participants, rather than mere observers. The Internet has become the battlefield, and for the first time, we are on the front lines. Elections are the political marketplace of ideas. Good candidates, policies and parties are introduced or retained while those experiencing low demand are weeded out. As a voter, you have a duty to partake in determining the future of your country by participating in this marketplace of ideas. You must decide whether you are willing to buy what the various parties and candidates are trying to sell you. No matter who you vote for or why, it is vital to remember that your vote determines your future, not your past. The past is often a useful indicia to the future, but this does not hold true in periods of change because changed circumstances result in unpredictable outcomes if the existing model does not adapt rapidly and sufficiently. Globalization, the influx of foreign wealth, and the inability of wages to keep up with inflation indicate changed circumstances. As voters, we must vote for whoever we think can deal with these new issues which may have no analogues in the past. Therefore, vote with regard to the future, not the past.Also, do not be afraid to vote with integrity. Rather, be afraid that if you do not and the outcome is not to your liking, it may well be because you forfeited your chance to create a different future. Do not be held hostage by fear or threats that your government will take less care of you because you voted for a different party. A government holds duties to all its citizens equally, and by voting with integrity, you hold your government accountable. Naturally, I expect that everyone who has voted in the past has voted with integrity, otherwise the concept of the ""peoples' mandate"" would be a farce. Nevertheless, this bears reminding. Vote with integrity.Finally, take comfort in the fact that, no matter who wins in the end, if everyone has voted with integrity and in regards to the future, Singapore will have taken a great step forward from ""A Singapore for the people"" to ""A Singapore for the people, by the people"".May the best men and women win.",The duties that accompany change

"While walking down the street one day a MP is tragically hit by a truck and dies. The MP's soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. ""Welcome to heaven,"" says St. Peter . ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, yousee, so we're not sure what to do with you."" ""No problem, just let me in,"" says the MP. St. Peter says, ""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then youcan choose where to spend eternity."" ""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in? heaven,"" says the MP. ""I'm sorry, but we have our rules"", replies St.Peter. And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of agreen golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting richat the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time thatbefore he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. ""Now it's time to visit heaven,"" St Peter says. So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good timeand the 24 hours in heaven passes by and St Peter returns. ""Well, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now which will you choose for your eternity?"" St Peter asks. The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers, ""Well, I never would have thought it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I wouldbe happier and better off .. in hell."" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The Devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ""I don't understand,"" stammers the MP. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drankchampagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"" The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.......Today .. YOU voted.

"I realised I can't.  I had already decided I was going to weigh the policies and proposals of the SDP against the PAP. Looking through them, I was torn between the pragmatism of the PAP and the idealism of the SDP. Yet at the same time, caught between the failed promises of the PAP and the naivety of the SDP. It seemed to me my only recourse was to pit the charisma of the ruling party against the enthusiasm of the opposition. I was excited. I got to vote and I got to do it well. Then suddenly a whirl of bad sportsmanship took over with the 'gay video' issue. I was thoroughly disheartened. Not only by the by the lack of grace displayed by the PAP candidates, but also by the way they used the gay issue, weilding it as if it should have anything to do with the elections. My social loyalties were called into question. Nonetheless, I decided to take into account only the way in which the issue was handled as opposed to the issue itself. Afterall, the grace and aplomb in which the opposition reacted to the issue was commendable and while I may have lost faith in one PAP candidate, the subtle chastise that PM Lee slipped into a speech restored my faith in the party as a whole.I was back to thinking objectively. Who did I agree more with? Who did I feel would aid the society more? The opposition candidates seemed strong and motivated, albeit lacking the finesse of the PAP. The PAP riding on it's success seemed confident it could do even more, even if it seemed a little tired. Hurrah for democracy. I got to vote between to parties that seemed equally capable, at least within the constituency. I mean, I do believe the PAP needs to remain in power as a whole, and I have no doubt it will, but for my constituency, I want the best possible party.Then suddenly another hurdle appeared. I was pointed to a video of another ruling party candidate during parliament. It was his address to parliament regarding the 377a issue. Interested in how he might carry himself, I decided to watch only to come away with the sense of unease. His speech did not weigh the practical or pragmatic problems that might arise from the repeal. Instead, it was a bigoted demonisation of the community disguised as a pragmatic discourse. Checking the facts, he lied about his statistics being more thorough regarding the question of whether homosexuality was genetic. I could have looked past this. I told myself I could. It's an wrongly informed opinion that should not affect my vote. But I could not look past what he said next. What he said next was so abhorrent I could hardly believe it came out of his mouth. He claimed that even if homosexuality was genetic, he would not recommend the repeal of the legislature. His reasons of genetic dispostions for kleptomania only fueled the rage within me even more. How could he deny basic rights to people who were born that way? How can someone be so bigoted as to believe that basic rights given to human beings to choose who they want to have sex with can be taken away on the basis of a disorder that is of a comepletely different nature? Could he really not see that whilst kleptomania infringed on someone else's right to ownership, homosexuality infringed on nobody else's rights? Or was this really a clever ploy to discredit the community once more?I have lost faith in objectivity. For the ruling party itself is not willing to remain objective. My heart can no longer allow my mind to consider the credit of candidates whose morals it has a complete disrespect for.tl;dnr: Read it or don't. It doesn't matter really, I just needed to put this into words...",Just when I thought I could make a decision I could actually say was completely objective...

I've been thinking about the possibility of raising a family there instead of in America. I have always wanted to be in finance/investing, perhaps with a biotech emphasis of some sort. Vague, I know.

"While the percentages surely reflect that the up-and-coming Opposition put up a good fight, (40+% in most constituencies is no joke), there is no denying that a clear majority would have been most encouraging. I was hoping to hit at least double digits of Opposition in Parliament.The good thing they did, that I appreciate is the fact that they competed independently in most constituencies save one, thus avoiding competition among themselves.However, this may have also hurt them. If every party was in some way fighting for the ""co-driver"" position, knowing for sure that alone they could not form the Parliament, they should have formed a temporary coalition at least this time around, to contest mega-party vs mega-party. The paradox of choice, and the size of the individual parties, may not have won that much confidence. It allowed PAP to deftly play the ""Disadvantages of coalition government"" card too easily. The temporary coalition could have played the ""Unity in Diversity"" card to counter this. That it's ok to have different viewpoints within the same party.Then there's this silent majority? What are the best ways to draw them out? Since establishing that the local new outlets are nothing more than PAP lackeys.I also think that the Opposition plays a bit too much on populist sentiments such as overly harsh criticism of foreign talent, for one thing. It's one thing to recognise the failings of a liberal immigration policy, but it's quite another to effectively demonise an increasingly significant population of the country, some of whom also have citizenships. In future, their kids will have citizenships too, and this population will grow. Of course they wouldn't vote for a party that mandates that it doesn't want them around.And blaming *everything else* on foreigners is a really negative sentiment, that also sends out an ugly image to the rest of the world. Housing prices increase are due to the market-price policy, merely accelerated by but not caused by foreigners.Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of crowded roads in a country where cars are seen as status symbols instead of tools that may be unnecessary. Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of frequencies and regular timings. Even in bigger cities with bigger populations elsewhere in the world, similar metro systmes adopt different techniques to achieve efficiency. More time learning those methods, less time blaming foreigners?And the #1 reason foreigners are preferred, blame the government &amp; its educational policies thus far. Every education policy is geared towards producing overachieving slave drones who're engineered to be good at gaming the system they study in.Even historically, the local universities were set up to supply undergraduates to the growing economy, *not* to educate future industrial leaders. And it shows. Even the University rankings are gamed, and not entirely deserved. Every course offered in University is a course that the local economy looks for, but nothing more.Compare with even a country like China? After their high school examinations the best stay *in* China in local Ivy universities, while the next best get scholarships to go everywhere else in the world. In Singapore, the best are only considered the best if they are educated outside of Singapore.Gtg for now, but hopefully we can continue this?",Discussing the issues brought up this GE 2011.
