Switching to Starhub was a big mistake.,"I had recently switched to Starhub from Singtel. I was ok with the fact that they told me that they would port my number in 7-10 days. But after the tenth day, I realised my number still wasn't ported. I made a call to them regarding this and they gave the silly excuse that they're undergoing some system upgrade/maintainence. So I waited and waited. Finally they sent me a text saying that my number has been ported successfully. Problem solved? Not quite.I found out that I could make outgoing calls and send outgoing text. But neither incoming calls nor text are working for me. It's been 7 days and counting that I'm living with this problem.Their customer service has been giving me the run around; Each time I gave them a call, their response is always one of these: 1)We would check on the problem and give you a call back, which they never did. 2) We have resetted your line and it would work in 24hrs. Yea, right, we're still here aren't we.I'm contemplating going down to their service centre to cancel my service with them and return the phone for a full refund. I have been with Singtel and M1 and I have to say, this is really, really atrocious. How could you let your customer not be contactable for a week and blame all this on system upgrades? I really think some thing is wrong with their customer service and I don't think I will ever use them nor will I recommend them to my family and friends. Not after I describe to them my ordeal.What a nightmare!",False,,,,

JC subject combinations,"So, the JAE posting comes out tomorrow. Like before, I have a couple of questions I hope some of you might be able to help me with.I feel fairly confident that I will be able to make it into a JC. So now, I need help with choosing my subjects. I've already decided on my 3 H2 subjects: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. But I'm still torn between H2 English Language and Linguistics, H1 Economics and H1/H2 Geography as my 4th subject. I've also contemplated taking up H2 Knowledge and Inquiry in place of the General Paper.* Linguistics - I like to read, but I'm not very interested in the emotional side of Literature, analysing how a poem or prose makes you feel. I am, however, interested in the more objective analysis of the language. Truth be told, one of the reasons I've thought about taking this subject was to become a better Grammar Nazi. One who knows for sure what he is talking about as opposed to merely going off his gut feel.* Economics - I don't intend on furthering my studies in this field, but I feel that a basic foundation in Econs would be useful in practical life in the future. I'm also mildy interested in how the Market works.* Geography - I took Geography at the 'O'-levels but didn't do terribly well (B3). I quite liked certain topics, such as Natural Vegetation and Development, but not so much the rest. H1 Geog has Plate Tectonics, which I didn't like at the 'O's, as well as Globalisation, Hydrologic Processes and Urban Issues, which I'm quite fine with. H2 Geog has all that H1 Geog has in addition to Atmospheric Processes and Population Issues, both of which I think I would be quite happy to learn.* Knowledge and Inquiry - Seems to deal with the nature of knowledge and analysis of arguments. I don't know much about this subject and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light.I'm also hoping to get some insight from someone who has taken 4 H2 subjects on what the work load is like, whether it's worth it and what the grading system is like.Thanks.",False,,,,

Stop pissing about!!!,"My fellow Singapore based males,This is a small rant focused on a certain percentage of you. It appears that unlike some of you, I am a master at urinating - the Yoda of Urination if you will. Why do I say this? Because I can stand at the correct distance from the urinal and ensure that I do not cover the porcelain, the floor, the wall and everything else in my urine. And I can do this EVERYTIME.Now I understand that we all come in different shapes and size. Some of us are tall, some of us are short, but I refuse to believe that the distance between the urethra and the final location of your urine will vary to any great extent.Yet I still find my office toilet, public toilets and even private toilets at upscale establishments covered in urine. Therefore I am led to believe that there is in fact a discrepancy between the distance of the urethra and the final destination. Furthermore I can only assume that many of you who commit this foul and unhygienic act have weak streams. As such the slight breeze from the air conditioning system may cause this weak stream to blow off course. A simple solution to this is to stand as close to the urinal as humanly possible. Another solution would be to train the weak PC muscles, the potential culprits behind your weak streams, with some Kegels exercises. These two potential solutions will lead to a far more pleasant experience for everyone involved.Whilst you may not mind your own urine soaking every last inch of the bathroom, others do (crazy I know!  Who wouldn't want to gallivant in your steaming liquid waste?). Be a man and piss in the right place. Also wash your hands, there is such a thing as splash back and the argument ""my penis is the cleanest part of me"" just doesn't fly.Also check your fly, no one needs to see the flag at half mast.

You stated we wrongly replaced the statistic you cited with another from Ms Rachel Chang’s article on March 8 (“School system still the ‘best way to move up’).&gt;Your original letter    “It is indeed heartwarming to learn that 90% of children from one-to-three-room flats do not make it to university.”&gt;Reasons we edited it: Factual error, sense.&gt;There were two problems with your sentence. First, it was contradictory and didn’t make sense.Your original sentence cannot mean what it says unless you were elated over the fact that nine in 10 children from less well-off homes failed to qualify for university. So we edited it for sense, i.e., underscoring a positive feeling (heartwarming) with a positive fact; rather than the self-penned irony of a positive feeling (heartwarming) backed by a negative fact (90% failure rate to university admission by less well off children). That was why we replaced the original statistic with the only one in Ms Chang’s March 8 report that matched your elation, that is, that 50 percent of less well off children found tertiary success.",False,,,,

"Hay guys! I'm moving to Singapore in two months, from New Zealand, and I would dearly love some advice on a few particulars.","So, I have just finished studying (in November), I just spent spent five months in America, and now I have booked some flights to Singapore where I hope to live and work for 6 months, and maybe even a year or two. Because I am a graduate from a reasonable university, I can get a working holiday visa, which gives me 6 months, and can be extended with sponsorship.  My query essentially boils down to three questions:* first, how difficult would it be for me to find work, and how long would this take, and how much could I hope to earn;* second, how much money should I take with me to get me into said work; and* third, what is it actually like living in Singapore, and where in the city should I live?About myself: I majored in Law and Pols (LLB / BA), I specialised mostly in commercial papers, so am really holding hoping for a job in banking, credit or finance, however, I have no experience in said fields.  I could also try for work in a law firm, but I would not be able to practice without completing the 5 month Professionals course in Singapore, and I imagine this would be very expensive.  I also have an online background, in advertising, having worked (mostly part time) for a major NZ website for four years.  My marks at uni were not great, and hovered around B+ / A- for arts and B+ / B for law.I was kind of on track, and then I read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/edt8b/does_anyone_know_a_good_headhunter_in_singapore/), which says it can take sometimes 6 months to land a job.

I mean, I know as well as any properly disillusioned adult that all that is just a load of propaganda tripe, but when did they stop even *pretending* they're looking out for anyone but themselves?If I may use an analogy, if a company makes a product that isn't well-received, that company would be swallowed alive if it blamed its customers for not liking a product they claim (over and over again) is fantastic and great and all that jazz.The only corporate entity that would survive a situation like that one that has established a monopoly. And our government has most certainly established a monopoly, one that is still behind a smokescreen of false power words such as ""republic"" and ""democratic"". They've bullied, prosecuted, and bankrupted the opposition, and now they claim that we shouldn't choose anyone but the sensationalist demagogues at PAP, who warn of terrible things to come if another party is elected to power.As if the Singaporean population as a whole is too dim-witted to choose what is best for themselves through a *democratic* election (although that word is really just become a bit of a joke around here).Meanwhile, as they claim to be fighting for our us, they grow fat on ridiculous salaries and mindboggling pension plans. A pension that awards them 70% of their salary! And let me remind you that our MPs each draw over S$200,000 a year. $S140,000 a year once they retire just seems ridiculous. And don't even get me started on our PM, SM, and MM's S$3.7 million.And they have the **audacity** to ask why they should work hard for people that aren't happy with their work? I think S$3.7 million in taxpayer money is more than enough incentive to work hard. Who knows, they might even make a half-hearted attempt to actually figure out why people are started to express dissatisfaction at how they're leading the country.Apologies for being so long winded.

Which maid to choose? by Ming Lee Lim ,"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home. My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes. For example:1)     She flooded my kitchen –  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn’t). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won’t happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!2)     She didn’t close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn’t apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying “What to do, it has happened.” Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don’t always want to come back at the end of the day.4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms).  Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are “Commited to Serve” – but I think it is just rhetoric and I don’t see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn’t big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors. I have to decide whether to renew my maid’s 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary. Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance. People say that the devil you know is better than one you don’t. But I feel that I can’t tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one? Appreciate your advice.Taken from: http://www.facebook.com/notes/ming-lee-lim/which-maid-to-choose/10150247540253273",False,,,,

The duties that accompany change,"Since the last General Election in 2006, Singaporeans have seen how social media helped a relatively unknown senator become president of the most powerful country in the world. Singaporeans have also watched as Egypt and Libya underwent political revolution driven by the desire of the people for change. We live in a time of change. We can taste it in the air. We are surrounded by it, we see it happening and we know that it is possible. This General Election will be one with many firsts. As Singaporeans living in a culture obsessed with being first, it is ironic that it has taken us so long to finally reach this stage of political development. For the first time in decades, opposition parties are challenging most of the seats in Parliament. As a result, many Singaporeans will have a chance to vote for the first time in our lives. For the first time in Singapore's history, voters are truly connected with the campaigns process as we utilize social media to report, investigate, question, criticize, defend and support candidates and parties. For the first time, we are active participants, rather than mere observers. The Internet has become the battlefield, and for the first time, we are on the front lines. Elections are the political marketplace of ideas. Good candidates, policies and parties are introduced or retained while those experiencing low demand are weeded out. As a voter, you have a duty to partake in determining the future of your country by participating in this marketplace of ideas. You must decide whether you are willing to buy what the various parties and candidates are trying to sell you. No matter who you vote for or why, it is vital to remember that your vote determines your future, not your past. The past is often a useful indicia to the future, but this does not hold true in periods of change because changed circumstances result in unpredictable outcomes if the existing model does not adapt rapidly and sufficiently. Globalization, the influx of foreign wealth, and the inability of wages to keep up with inflation indicate changed circumstances. As voters, we must vote for whoever we think can deal with these new issues which may have no analogues in the past. Therefore, vote with regard to the future, not the past.Also, do not be afraid to vote with integrity. Rather, be afraid that if you do not and the outcome is not to your liking, it may well be because you forfeited your chance to create a different future. Do not be held hostage by fear or threats that your government will take less care of you because you voted for a different party. A government holds duties to all its citizens equally, and by voting with integrity, you hold your government accountable. Naturally, I expect that everyone who has voted in the past has voted with integrity, otherwise the concept of the ""peoples' mandate"" would be a farce. Nevertheless, this bears reminding. Vote with integrity.Finally, take comfort in the fact that, no matter who wins in the end, if everyone has voted with integrity and in regards to the future, Singapore will have taken a great step forward from ""A Singapore for the people"" to ""A Singapore for the people, by the people"".May the best men and women win.",False,,,,

Vote wisely....! by Gregory Leow,"While walking down the street one day a MP is tragically hit by a truck and dies. The MP's soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. ""Welcome to heaven,"" says St. Peter . ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, yousee, so we're not sure what to do with you."" ""No problem, just let me in,"" says the MP. St. Peter says, ""Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then youcan choose where to spend eternity."" ""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in? heaven,"" says the MP. ""I'm sorry, but we have our rules"", replies St.Peter. And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of agreen golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting richat the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne. Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time thatbefore he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him. ""Now it's time to visit heaven,"" St Peter says. So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good timeand the 24 hours in heaven passes by and St Peter returns. ""Well, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now which will you choose for your eternity?"" St Peter asks. The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers, ""Well, I never would have thought it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I wouldbe happier and better off .. in hell."" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. The Devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ""I don't understand,"" stammers the MP. ""Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drankchampagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"" The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.......Today .. YOU voted.

Just when I thought I could make a decision I could actually say was completely objective...,"I realised I can't.  I had already decided I was going to weigh the policies and proposals of the SDP against the PAP. Looking through them, I was torn between the pragmatism of the PAP and the idealism of the SDP. Yet at the same time, caught between the failed promises of the PAP and the naivety of the SDP. It seemed to me my only recourse was to pit the charisma of the ruling party against the enthusiasm of the opposition. I was excited. I got to vote and I got to do it well. Then suddenly a whirl of bad sportsmanship took over with the 'gay video' issue. I was thoroughly disheartened. Not only by the by the lack of grace displayed by the PAP candidates, but also by the way they used the gay issue, weilding it as if it should have anything to do with the elections. My social loyalties were called into question. Nonetheless, I decided to take into account only the way in which the issue was handled as opposed to the issue itself. Afterall, the grace and aplomb in which the opposition reacted to the issue was commendable and while I may have lost faith in one PAP candidate, the subtle chastise that PM Lee slipped into a speech restored my faith in the party as a whole.I was back to thinking objectively. Who did I agree more with? Who did I feel would aid the society more? The opposition candidates seemed strong and motivated, albeit lacking the finesse of the PAP. The PAP riding on it's success seemed confident it could do even more, even if it seemed a little tired. Hurrah for democracy. I got to vote between to parties that seemed equally capable, at least within the constituency. I mean, I do believe the PAP needs to remain in power as a whole, and I have no doubt it will, but for my constituency, I want the best possible party.Then suddenly another hurdle appeared. I was pointed to a video of another ruling party candidate during parliament. It was his address to parliament regarding the 377a issue. Interested in how he might carry himself, I decided to watch only to come away with the sense of unease. His speech did not weigh the practical or pragmatic problems that might arise from the repeal. Instead, it was a bigoted demonisation of the community disguised as a pragmatic discourse. Checking the facts, he lied about his statistics being more thorough regarding the question of whether homosexuality was genetic. I could have looked past this. I told myself I could. It's an wrongly informed opinion that should not affect my vote. But I could not look past what he said next. What he said next was so abhorrent I could hardly believe it came out of his mouth. He claimed that even if homosexuality was genetic, he would not recommend the repeal of the legislature. His reasons of genetic dispostions for kleptomania only fueled the rage within me even more. How could he deny basic rights to people who were born that way? How can someone be so bigoted as to believe that basic rights given to human beings to choose who they want to have sex with can be taken away on the basis of a disorder that is of a comepletely different nature? Could he really not see that whilst kleptomania infringed on someone else's right to ownership, homosexuality infringed on nobody else's rights? Or was this really a clever ploy to discredit the community once more?I have lost faith in objectivity. For the ruling party itself is not willing to remain objective. My heart can no longer allow my mind to consider the credit of candidates whose morals it has a complete disrespect for.tl;dnr: Read it or don't.

Discussing the issues brought up this GE 2011.,"While the percentages surely reflect that the up-and-coming Opposition put up a good fight, (40+% in most constituencies is no joke), there is no denying that a clear majority would have been most encouraging. I was hoping to hit at least double digits of Opposition in Parliament.The good thing they did, that I appreciate is the fact that they competed independently in most constituencies save one, thus avoiding competition among themselves.However, this may have also hurt them. If every party was in some way fighting for the ""co-driver"" position, knowing for sure that alone they could not form the Parliament, they should have formed a temporary coalition at least this time around, to contest mega-party vs mega-party. The paradox of choice, and the size of the individual parties, may not have won that much confidence. It allowed PAP to deftly play the ""Disadvantages of coalition government"" card too easily. The temporary coalition could have played the ""Unity in Diversity"" card to counter this. That it's ok to have different viewpoints within the same party.Then there's this silent majority? What are the best ways to draw them out? Since establishing that the local new outlets are nothing more than PAP lackeys.I also think that the Opposition plays a bit too much on populist sentiments such as overly harsh criticism of foreign talent, for one thing. It's one thing to recognise the failings of a liberal immigration policy, but it's quite another to effectively demonise an increasingly significant population of the country, some of whom also have citizenships. In future, their kids will have citizenships too, and this population will grow. Of course they wouldn't vote for a party that mandates that it doesn't want them around.And blaming *everything else* on foreigners is a really negative sentiment, that also sends out an ugly image to the rest of the world. Housing prices increase are due to the market-price policy, merely accelerated by but not caused by foreigners.Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of crowded roads in a country where cars are seen as status symbols instead of tools that may be unnecessary. Crowded buses &amp; trains are a function of frequencies and regular timings. Even in bigger cities with bigger populations elsewhere in the world, similar metro systmes adopt different techniques to achieve efficiency. More time learning those methods, less time blaming foreigners?And the #1 reason foreigners are preferred, blame the government &amp; its educational policies thus far. Every education policy is geared towards producing overachieving slave drones who're engineered to be good at gaming the system they study in.Even historically, the local universities were set up to supply undergraduates to the growing economy, *not* to educate future industrial leaders. And it shows. Even the University rankings are gamed, and not entirely deserved. Every course offered in University is a course that the local economy looks for, but nothing more.Compare with even a country like China? After their high school examinations the best stay *in* China in local Ivy universities, while the next best get scholarships to go everywhere else in the world. In Singapore, the best are only considered the best if they are educated outside of Singapore.Gtg for now, but hopefully we can continue this?",False,,,,

What areas would be good for a 22 year-old (have a semi-tight budget) working at a bank, who likes to do outdoor activities, but also isn't devoid of going out at night?4.  Internet.  I hear it's great there, given you have the right provider.  I'm a moderate gamer and definitely relish in fast speeds.  I don't watch a lot of TV so the best cable isn't much of an issue.5.  Apparel.  I just bought myself another pair of jeans as I hear they're all the rage there.  I know I'm going to look out of place in the beginning, but I definitely want to be able to look more like a local as I get more experienced living there.  Suggestions?Anyway, I'll keep this on the shorter end as I don't want to bog you guys down with millions of questions.  But if you can think of any good advice that I didn't ask about here, please feel free to mention it.  I'm so excited to move there!edit1:  Hey, just remembered.  I'm also looking to be somewhat knowledgeable about Singapore and the latest news/going-ons before/while I get there.  Any good sources for that?  Also, most importantly, I'm a vegetarian and I eat extremely healthy (although that doesn't mean I don't try new things or let loose where appropriate).  Just wondering if it's easy to eat veggie there (I imagine it is), and if there are good shopping places to buy health foods?",False,,,,

Long-term dog boarding options in Singapore?,"I'm a Singaporean living overseas, and will be abroad for the foreseeable future. I own an adorable Labrador Retriever who's pushing 15 years in age, and whom I've solely taken care of for his first 10 years before I had to leave for college. Since then it's been a combination of family and domestic helpers who've helped to keep him well and happy; however, recent circumstances have made this difficult, and my father is reluctant to remain his sole caretaker. My lab is really sweet and friendly, and always has the energy for a long walk. His hips have gotten a little stiff in the last couple years, and his eyesight a little poorer; his coat has always been thin in the Singaporean heat, and from what my dad tells me, he has developed an open sore on one leg that vets haven't been able to figure out. So I'm looking for alternatives to kennel boarding, as my dog clearly requires more individualized care -- kennels are pretty awful in any case. Most of my Singaporean friends live in high rises, and cannot help out. Does anyone know of, or provide, a humane, attentive long-term boarding situation? Preferably in the East, but that isn't required. Care would include daily walks, regular grooming and vet visits. Cost is not an issue, and everything will be covered including food and medication.

Serious weightlifting gyms in Singapore other than SWFF?,"Hi r/singapore. I'm currently locked in a two-year contract with California Fitness, which has become an awful butt since they moved to Takashimaya.

(I'm on the [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki) program.) The first time I went back this summer I had to wait 20 minutes to start my workout. On top of that, I was told flat out that they had no plans to ever get bumper plates because they were a ""corporate"" gym, not a ""sports"" gym. Yeah. I've been going to the Singapore Weightlifting Federation gym near the Indoor Sports Stadium in Kallang.

Second time's the charm-Singapore Meetup Redux-July 23rd,"Hey fellow redditors!

I was thinking we could hit up Clarke Quay since there's tons of shit going on there and there are a couple of pretty sick bars (Se7en Inch and Crazy Elephant are sweet). If you have a better idea of a place to go,comment and let's get this discussion going :). I was thinking July 23rd (Saturday Night after 6-7pm), what do you guys and gals think?    The options so far:   [Wala Wala @ Holland Village](http://www.worldsbestbars.com/wala-wala-cafe-bar-in-singapore.htm)  [Crazy Elephant @ Clarke Quay](http://www.crazyelephant.com/aboutus.html)  [Se7en Inch @ Clarke Quay](http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/bars/se7en1nch)  btw se7en inch is not as sleazy as that article makes it out to be....disappointingly :p    **Update 1**: Seems to be a lot of love for Holland Village right now with 2 bars named, Wala Wala and now [Baden](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/baden_restaurant_pub/). Looks like this is shaping up to be some fun    **Update 2**: Alright so far it looks like more people are into Holland Village for a meetup. It's a little more relaxed and doesn't have as much of a tourist trap feel. Plus it'll be good busy not mad rush busy like i'm assuming Clarke Quay will be. The bars will probably alternate between Baden and Wala Wala. They are [5 minutes apart on the same road](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=31+Lorong+Mambong,+277689&amp;daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong,+277698&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=1.31174,103.794421&amp;spn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;sll=1.31175,103.794405&amp;sspn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;geocode=FbEDFAAd7MYvBikRgeiVaxraMTH9M6ZJgog47g%3BFZgEFAAdJscvBiGB7WF_My68Bg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=19) so it's a non issue. Baden is a bit of a quieter less expensive hangout joint, and wala wala has higher prices overall but also provides for a second level with a live band. What's the general preference? Post comments. For the record i'd ideally like to start at baden and abuse their happy hour and then see where the rowdy reddit crowd will want to go afterwards. Thoughts?    **FINAL UPDATE:** Hey guys. So it's decided that this shindig is going down at Holland Village. For your convenience, [**here are some directions**](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=Buona+Vista+Mrt+Station+North+Buona+Vista+Road&amp;daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=1.30919,103.79179&amp;spn=0.005824,0.010568&amp;sll=1.308793,103.792262&amp;sspn=0.005824,0.010568&amp;geocode=FdrzEwAda7IvBiElGrU3lFMJew%3BFYIEFAAdyMYvBilDkAyUaxraMTHsMM73UF_Pzw&amp;gl=sg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=r&amp;ttype=now&amp;noexp=0&amp;noal=0&amp;sort=def&amp;z=17&amp;start=0) from the Buona Vista MRT station to The Baden and Wala Wala Cafe. It is pretty straightforward.    I'm aiming to be at Baden at 7pm (i'll be on time, this time I swear) and I'll see if we can get some space to ourselves while people come in. After everyone's there we can sorta decide on what people would like to get up to. I hope that gels with you guys.

They disagree it's a breach of contract, and require me to pay early termination charges.

(She from Christmas Island and is Australian) So they are now married under law and she is stuck on a social visit pass here, unable to find a job.Unlike the US and some other countries, been married to a citizen of Singapore does not automatically give you access to PR status. Our PR system here is based on your own merit, qualifications and ability to find a job here, something that I am sure our many PR redditors can bare witness too. Marriage is taken into consideration, but it is only a secondary factor. PS: please do feel free to correct or add to this post.",False,,,,

NTU Exchange student would like some clarification on Internet policy.,"Let me first apologize if this is a niche post clogging up the r/singapore page, but the dedicated r/ntu subreddit is woefully underpopulated.  I'm a Canadian and I'm beginning to realize that there are some pretty zero-tolerance policies here for things that we wouldn't think twice about back home.  So that sucks.  As regards the Internet specifically, would anyone know what the actual leeway is on our user accounts?Living in residence in Canada, we were supposedly barred from torrenting stuff, but we weren't really.  What would happen was that you would be banned for two hours from using the Internet, but your torrenting would continue unaffected.  So if I was torrenting all night and shut my computer off at 8 am, by 10 am I could go back online.Direct peer to peer stuff it wouldn't pick up on either.  So anything like Limewire was okay.In the NTU crucifixion of speech [internet policy](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits/securityregulations/studentrulesregulations/Pages/default.aspx), it warns against 'anything illegal,' such as unauthorized copying, transmission of copywrited materials, 'sexually suggestive' material, etc.  ""Users are reminded that any violation of the Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, will be liable to a fine up to $50,000 or to imprisonment of up to 10 years or both.""Normally, I torrent movies and music like a motherfucker, but I'm a bit unnerved by all of this decade in prison stuff.Can anyone advise me one way or the other?  Is filesharing (or direct downloading) okay, or am I going to have to live in between the narrow lines of authority for a year?TL;DR: Can I torrent in NTU residence safely, or will I be fined and/or be sent to jail?EDIT:  Thanks everyone, you've been really helpful.  I'm not worried about jail anymore, it just seems like I have to circumvent whatever security's in place.  ",False,,,,

Something I would like to share,"Remember [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jei42/i_dont_understand_this_at_all/)?Well guess what I saw this morning. I saw my neighbour posting to the group. I would like to share her story.Now, she is 13 this year, just started secondary school. Before that she went to a normal primary school and was doing quite well. (Read as Band 1 - Band 2 and in Pri 6 A's )Her mom wanted her to go to SCGS or some other (insert top school name here) and well she had potential to do so. Then, she botched up her PSLE and got 220+ T-score. This isn't too bad. Since we were in the east there were some schools whose minimum T-score was around 220-225.However her mom did not place these schools with 220+ T-scores into her selection form, instead she put many top schools into the spots for the 1st choice 2nd choice 3 choice... and so on.She ended up going to a normal neighbourhood school (which is still ok if you hang out with the right people). She began to hang around the other type of students and her parents bought her an iPhoneNot long after that, he facebook friends list ballooned (1107 friends as of now), and vulgarities started streaming out in the posts.I'm not against vulgarity or anythingbut I found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jei42/i_dont_understand_this_at_all/c2bhch7) by makanguru to be quite accurate. The parents are the ones who influence the fate of their children the company the child is in also is a major factor.It also takes a while for the child to wake up and start working hard for their own future. It's not impossible to get out of a bad academic situation but as Will Roger has put it ""If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging""**TL;DR - The parents of the children in that group are at fault if their children ends up as a good-for-nothing**If this post seems poorly worded or something, I apologise, it's late in the night and i'm hungry.",False,,,,

Looking for local advice,"Hello Singaporean redditors.I pretty much never post on reddit, much less /r/Singapore, but something has come up and I was hoping for some local advice.I have been asked by my work to move to Singapore for two years.  While I haven’t said yes yet I am strongly considering it, and so have to consider what my life would be like in Singapore.  Step one is figuring out where I would live.Now I’ve been to Singapore before so I know my way around a bit, but I’ve never had to consider living here on a long term basis.  My favorite areas are pretty much the three Quays (Clarke, Boat and Robertson) with their upscale restaurants and bars.  I’m not big into clubbing, but good restaurants and a nice western style pub or bar where I can down some beers is pretty important to me.  I’ve never been down to Holland Village but from what I read I would probably enjoy that area also.That’s all well and good but I would not be working in the central area.  For work I will probably shuffle back and forth between the areas surrounding Changi airport and Seletar airport.  That would mean at least a 30 minute commute by car each way, even longer if the traffic is bad.  Meanwhile if I were to stay somewhere like Pasir Ris, Tampines, or Punggol, I would have a short commute, and cheaper rent.  I don’t have any experience with the areas I just mentioned, other than on a map I see they are located between the two airports.But, it seems to me that the area surround the three quays are not that common here.  For example, I am currently staying in the Hougang area in a short term condo rented by work. (Going back home to the states this week, the two year stint wouldn’t begin until late this year or maybe early next year) On the first two floors of my building are a grocery store and shopping complex, with a kopitiam comprised of maybe 10 different food stalls.  Beyond that everything I see are just residential high rises.  So unless I want to put forth the effort to get in a cab and go somewhere else, the only place I can find food is in the kopitiam or the various McDonalds and KFC in the shopping complex.  And the only place I can have a beer is also just the kopitiam, which is kind of awkward.  My intuition is that the areas I mentioned as being physically closer would be very much like Hougang.So I’m wondering if locals with more knowledge can recommend any areas that combine the atmosphere of an area like Clarke/Boat/Robertson Quay or Holland Village, but is actually physically closer to the north east to allow for quick travel to either Changi or Seletar.Thanks!Edit: meant to say an area in the north east, not north west.Edit2: Like I mentioned, I don't post much so I don't really know the best way to thank you guys. (Other than upvotes) So I'll just mention here that thanks for the suggestions.  Sounds like Serangoon gardens and tanjong katong are good places to start looking, along with the other suggestions.",False,,,,

American born Chinese considering moving to Singapore to look for a career.,"I'm born and raised in America, im Chinese and my parents are from HK so i speak chinese pretty fluently as long as it isn't too technical. I have a bachelors degree in liberal studies (like a general degree) and will have a bunch of child development certificates. Basically I have been working as an After school teacher for the last two years with elementary school children. Right now im working as a special needs instructional aide in a class room filled with autistic children in an elementary school. And im on my way to getting a site supervisor permit for preschool. I was planning on becoming an elementary school teacher but things didn't really work out for me and i've been looking at other master degrees like social work and other stuff but it's getting pretty expensive here and doesn't seem like its worth the extra money for a such a low paying job.I want a career or job where i can help people out or teach english but jobs over here don't really pay much and i kind of want to move outside the US for maybe a year or two. Is there something similar to craigslist over in Singapore where i can find job listings and apartment listings so i can get an idea of how much living might cost and how much the jobs pay over there? How is the job market for preschool or daycare especially for guys? Is teaching english worthwhile over there?What would I need to move over to Singapore and look for a job? A visa?  Thank you so much guys! I know I posted a ton of questions but i figured not everyone would know the answers to all the questions anyways and its good the have different perspectives.",False,,,,

Do you feel that there are issues I should be aware of? I humbly request your informed advice Reddit!","A little background:I work for a marketing company in London; which has offices all over the world (Boston, Tokyo, Guyana, Barbados, and Singapore).The Singapore office has only been around for a year, and its not doing very well (inexperience from top to bottom). So the company decided to send someone out there with the right skills and experience to go and help lead that team. After a long and thorough interview process with over 10 other candidates, I was chosen as that guy.I've always wanted to work abroad, somewhere far and different (and preferably hot). So when this opportunity arose, I jumped at it without thinking twice! Luckily, I have no tie-downs like a gf, or mortgage; I can leave my flat at short notice without any hassle.As it stands, the logistics of the move are still being planned and executed, on-the-fly. However, I have been told that the company will take care of things like flights, visas, accommodation for the first two months and medical insurance. Again, the details of this package are still being worked out. My current salary is approx £26,000 pa, which translates to roughly S$50,000. The company said they will look at how much they will need to increase this figure; apparently its a very expensive city.Reddit, I've never asked you for anything before, but now I need to ask you for your expert, worldly, informed (and often hilarious) advice.Can anyone tell me what kind of salary I would need to live comfortably out there ? Any and all advice you guys might provide would be truly invaluable to me.**TL;DR - I'm young, unprepared, and about to move from London to Singapore; is there anything I should know before I go?****EDIT:** I posted this before I went to bed, and the responses I'm seeing are really awesome!

Do come :)**Moving half way around the world for 6 months of the year has many ups, but it comes with a few downs. For me, missing a handful of big events back home is the biggest downside. One of those big events that actually made me consider staying in Ireland is my brother's 21st birthday party. It's on this Friday night in Ireland and I am very, very sorry to not be there.However, I'm not going to let 11,228 kilometers keep me from celebrating his birthday! Even if it's just me alone having a pint in his name. Obviously though this is an opportunity for a little /r/singapore get-together, so I'd like to make the most of it. I don't know if it would count as an *official* meetup, since there's minimal effort going into the organisation, but certainly all redditors are welcome!I have an idea in my head too. His party is starting at 8 pm Irish time, which is 3 am SG time. There'll be a projector at the party looping through pics and videos of him growing up, so I'd like to send over pics and videos of his brother and a bunch of strangers celebrating his birthday in Singapore, which would be shown during his party. ""I might not be there, but I'm damn well marking the occasion. Happy Birthday bro"". Seems like a nice sentiment.So, anyone up for this? If anyone has any plans or ideas, just shout! I'm open to all suggestions. Bar Bar Black Sheep again? Holland village? Clarke Quay? Throw out ideas. Gimme feedback.Also, I may bring cake.Can't have a birthday celebration without cake.",False,,,,

/r/singapore Trick or Treat Meetup,"**UPDATE: CHANGE OF VENUE TO BREWERKS**After much discussion, consideration, conference calls, top-level meetings, deliberations, contingency plans, projections and pub talk, my good self and the wonderful apurva_p have decided on a ~~loose~~ *more solid* plan for the **Global Reddit Trick or Treat Meetup**!So, most importantly, the venue. ~~There isn't a booking yet, but we think that **Bar Bar Black Sheep** on Robertson Quay (the location of the August meetup) would be a great location, for a number of reasons which will be explained in due time.~~ We have booked an outside table for 20 people in **Brewerkz** in Clarke Quay!Secondly, since it's Hallowe'en, I'm sure you're wondering about costumes and the like. Well, fear not you beautiful, socially awkward reddiporeans out there for **we don't really care if you decided to wear a costume or not**. Seriously. First and foremost, this is a meetup - costumes are secondary. The point is to come along, meet a bunch of redditors, share stories, have some fun, eat, drink and be merry as much or as little as you like, safe in the knowledge that you are surrounded by like-minded and devilishly attractive people.Of course, *if you want* to wear a costume or face paint or wear a mask, then by all means, do! Personally, I'd love to see hoobaga in a giant penguin costume *(hint, hint)* but it's up to you. No pressure, no worries.We have a few ideas for Hallowe'en games but need to work out a few issues first. I had the idea of playing [apple bobbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_bobbing) and then thought we could make it better and a bit more local by turning it into... wait for it... DURIAN BOBBING!How about pumpkin carving? If anyone knows where we could get decent-sized pumpkins, let us know and apurva_p or I shall bring them.Lastly, it's Hallowe'en so there's one tradition we can't leave out - stuffing our faces with chocolate/sweets/candy! So, please bring a bag of sweets or something to share (if you can) and we shall all gorge on the sugary goodness.~~ As I said, BBBS isn't finalized yet but it ~~ Brewerkz works because it's outside (for apple/durian bobbing), they have a big table to fit all of us and it's close to Clarke Quay if the night takes us in that direction.Give us your thoughts, ideas and suggestions here!**TL;DR Global Reddit Trick or Treat Meetup - 22nd of October in [Brewerkz](http://www.brewerkz.com/) from 8 pm.

Collective advice/guides/tips/knowledge on travelling around the region,"Whaddup Reddiporeans.  I've finally hurtled 3 months of official work, so I can now begin planning Leave Days!I'm wondering if we can begin a discussion that provides an all-around resource for people wanting to travel around SEA (or even other Eastern-Pacific destinations).I know there are guides you can buy, or other resources on the internet, but I've found over the years that the most reliable, and usually best recommended trips come from people of a like mind (given you're reading this on reddit I'm assuming we all share some weird trains of thought). Some things I think the post can highlight are:-Country (duh) and specific cities or sites within-What's best to go there for (nightlife, culture, big sites, food, all-around, etc)-Best time to go (season/holidays/events/natural phenomena/etc)-What's the best way of travel (and for that matter where best to book)-Your favorite experience if you have been to said destination-How cheap/good is the beer there? (oh, and I guess other expenses would be nice as well)Of course you can post whatever you want to whatever degree, but some supplemental info could be:-Where NOT to go (overrated, yadda yadda)-How best to travel to a destination (good for personal experience/growth, in group, couples destination, etc)-Any other good resources you have found for supplemental country/trip info.For those of you unfortunate enough not to have met me yet, I ask all this because this is the first time I've ever been to Asia and although I'm fairly cultured and internationally-aware, I really know nothing beyond what either movies/shows have shown me, or what happens to be common knowledge.  Neither of which I can really trust for candid experience.  I'm sure there are people in similar situations and this could also be very helpful for people visiting and using Singapore as a home base for regional travel.",False,,,,

Walking across Singapore as a fundraiser. Need additional information.,"So about a month ago someone made a post asking how long it would take to walk from one side of Singapore to the other. **[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kqew9/how_long_does_it_take_to_walk_from_one_side_of/)**A comment provided **[this route](http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Tuas+South+Ave+5&amp;daddr=Tanah+Merah+Coast+Rd&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=1.324464,104.003792&amp;sspn=0.037713,0.066047&amp;geocode=FdZ2EwAdMiItBg%3BFRAaFAAdiDgzBg&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;t=m&amp;z=12)**.I thought this would be a cool thing to do, to be able to say I've trekked across an entire country. I brought it up to some friends and they're interested in doing it as well. We're here working in the US Navy up at Sembawang and decided to see if we can turn it into a fundraiser. Our plan is to source out businesses who would donate money, and maybe a few t-shirts, for us to do the walk. ALL money raised would be donated to a local Singaporean social services organization. We're thinking of donating to **[Beyond Social Services](http://www.beyond.org.sg/)** an organization that provides programs for children and youth.So, a few questions...* Is the above route possible? Is there anything preventing us from walking through said route? Anything restricted? We're not worried about terrain, and we plan to start from one water-lined coast until we reach the other.* Are there any other organizations that we might be able to donate to?* Are there any businesses, preferably with easy to find contact info, that we can ask to sponsor us?* Is there anything you think we can add to make this better?We're shooting for 11NOV, which is Veterans Day in the US.

Singapore cross-country walk a go! Updated info inside.,"**[FACEBOOK EVENT FOR THE WALK - RSVP AND PASS IT ON TO INTERESTED FRIENDS](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=309783632372487)****EDIT (28OCT)**: We drove the entire route and because of the awesome smells coming from the Tuas Industrial area, we decided to modify the start point slightly. We'll begin walking from Raffles Marina and end at Changi Naval Base. **[Here's the new route](http://bit.ly/tvqAUI)**I won't make another thread about this, just didn't know a better way to provide updated information without it being buried.I had a meeting with the director of Beyond Social Services on Saturday and they gave me the go ahead. They will provide me a letter on Monday which I can use to validate this effort should anyone question where the money is going. They also said that they will contact someone at the Singapore Tourism Board to see if there's some involvement they can provide. Finally, they're looking at the original route to see if it can be modified so that the path will go near some of their buildings and perhaps the kids can come out to welcome us and/or walk a small portion of the route.My next steps are:* Come up with a name for the walk, so they can include it in their advertising. Any suggestions?????* Start writing letters to the various companies informing them of the walk and soliciting donations, all of which go to BSS.* Drive the proposed route this week to see if there are any glaring problems that need to be corrected.I don't know if we'll raise any money, but I'm going to try. The date of the walk is November 11th. I know that some of you asked if you could join on the walk. I think it's a great idea, but please understand that you will have to bring your own food and water and make your own way to the starting point. I don't expect this to be incredibly easy, but I doubt people will be falling out. If you would like to walk with us, please PM me to let me know and I'll message you directly with any updates/information.REGARDING DONATIONS: BSS provided me with a funds form that people can use to donate money to them and receive a receipt for tax purposes. If anyone would like a copy to maybe donate themselves or ask friends, family or colleagues, please PM me. For more information about the organization, check out the **[Beyond Social Services](http://beyond.org.sg)** website.**EDIT (24OCT):** I've decided to call it ""The Lion City Stroll."" I know it's corny, but that's not always a bad thing. I was considering the Majulah March, but figured it could potentially be offensive. I've also drafted the fund raising request letter and sent it to Beyond Social Services to see if they object to anything regarding what I wrote about their organization. My plan is to start mailing letters out tomorrow. I'm just going to various corporate websites and sending it to the press/media points of contact...I've never done this before, so I'm a noob. **For those who want to attend, please PM me your e-mail and phone number. My # is 96360009 should you want to SMS your details.**One of my co-workers is going to have a dinner for all participants to carb-load the evening before at his house in Sembawang.

I hope someone donates. I also made a Facebook event for the walk so we can try spreading the word to people who live here but obviously aren't on reddit.

Estimated cost for bicycle rental is about $8-12 for a full day, for a good/decent bike. However you can probably rent them from as low as $2 a day. Do remember to ask for a bike lock when renting the bicycle. A rough plan for the day is as follows: Bring lunch and water with you, we'll cycle around for a while and stop at a beach for lunch at around 1pm. After which we can head to [Chek Jawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Jawa) for a couple of hours and enjoy ourselves. [NParks' Website](http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/popup/pulau-attractions.html) says that in order to fully experience chek jawa the tide should be below 0.5m. Sadly on the 7th it doesn't go below that.. (lowest is 1.1m, at 1500H). After which we can continue cycling around the island and see quarries/temples/wildboars or whatever. Leave the island at  6pm, head for dinner at Changi Village (pretty damn good food there and food at Ubin kinda sucks), and head home. $25 should be more than enough to cover your needs for the whole day. Things to bring:* $$* Snacks, **Water and Lunch** * Mosquito Repellant (as strong as you can get)* A hat and or shades ~~and a tailored Italian suit~~* Poncho/Umbrella ... Just in case.* Your favorite sun screen* Camera! (You won't regret this)* OPTIONAL: A change of clothes, if you want to play in the water (lol) or if you perspire like Moist from Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long blog. * Whatever else you think you may need**A piece of advice: Sometimes on ubin your cellphone will pick up the Malaysian telco signal instead of the Singapore one. So please switch off your mobile internet/3G when you're on the island to avoid being ass-raped by your telco.** Pulau ubin is mainland Singapore's hardcore cousin.. so don't expect fairies and butterflies (ok, maybe you'll see some butterflies). If we're lucky we'll get to see cool animals unique to the island. Maybe we'll all get lost together, who knows! But that's the spirit of adventure. Please leave a message here if you're interested in going! I'll finalize the details by the end of the week. But expect the current date and time to be stuck to. Think about it! If you have questions just post below or PM me. If you want my number you can PM me too. My name's Tim. **LATEST UPDATE: This is confirmed to be on the 7th November. If you're driving/taking a cab, meet everyone at Changi Village Jetty at 9.45am. If you're taking a bus, meet everyone at Tanah Merah MRT Station at 9am. To get to the Jetty, we'll have to take bus 2 from tanah merah bus stop and stop at changi village terminal, then take a 5 minute walk to the Jetty. Remember to pack your lunch, we'll be eating on Noordin/Mamam Beach at Pulau Ubin. For those who have no idea who I am or how to find any of us at Tanah Merah, please PM me and I'll get back to you with my number, as well as Darren's number (hope you don't mind), in case I fail to pick up my phone (he's the unofficial co-organizer).** [Also, something cool to read while waiting for Monday to come!](http://www.sgkopi.com/ubin/2011/01/internet-searches/) ",False,,,,

Also, free Hats!","Alright, so I've officially joined the ranks of Movember after easy convincing by my Dad (who's also participating).  Just some quick info on this event for those who don't know: Briefly, it’s where men (or women if they are so inclined and able) let their mustaches grow towards excellence all during the month of November.  It is in order to raise awareness and funds towards men’s health, specifically in the area of prostate cancer (which 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with in their lifetime).  Another astounding fact is that 1 in 2 men will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, which is all the worse since ~24% of men are less likely to go to the doctor compared to women.   Both my grandfather and dad were diagnosed with and survived Prostate Cancer so I’m planning on bucking that trend, and I could use your help!  There’s more information here at this website if you’re interested. http://us.movember.com/about And if you’re even more so inclined, you can make a donation to my family’s team – which all goes towards the Movember Foundation, a partner of Prostate Cancer Foundation and Livestrong – but of course there’s absolutely no pressure whatsoever to do this, just spread the word!And if you're EVEN MORE ecstatic about this (as I'm sure most of you are), then feel free to join the movement.  You can be an individual campaigner, or feel free to join the team I'm on, Team: GOMO.  Just go here &lt;http://us.movember.com/register/&gt; and click REGISTER and proceed.

Need help. Anyone work for MOM? (Minister of Manpower),"Hey guys,So here's the situation. A while ago, an awesome friend of mine managed to get me a job in the company he works for in Sing (i don't want to get into the details, just in case). Even though i'm originally Canadian, i grew up in Sing and only came back to Canada for University. I've always wanted to go back after my studies, so this was incredible news.The only problem is that i've heard that MOM is tightening up on foreign immigration, so i'm scared that once i get there, even though i might have the job, i won't be able to get an Employment Pass. I've tried contacting the Consulate in Washington (there isn't one in Canada), but they told me to talk to MOM. Basically, i'm looking for some kind of assurance that i can get a work permit before i go and spend a few thousand dollars on the plane ticket + living expenses to get back to Sing.

American looking to move back to Singapore and look for jobs.

I am going to graduate with a Bachelors degree in Economics and Statistics this coming December. Judging by the current state of the economy in America, I want to move back to Singapore since it would be easier for me to save and cost of living is less than living here in the US. Also, I miss my friends and the food. My parents are currently residing in Singapore so it is easy for me to find a place to stay temporary till I find a job.I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions in looking for jobs in Singapore.

I think you beer drinkers might like this shop my dad found,"My dad found a wholesaler that sells cheap beer. He got a case of 24 bottles of hoegaarden at $2.50 a bottle, that's even cheaper than airport prices. He also mentioned that it has hard liquor and other types of beer.He said its located at Toa Payoh Lor 7 Block 18 or 19, opposite the SPC gas station. I checked the HDB website and the only shop that seems to match is at [block 19 #01-276](http://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/AA16RMSBusinessDirectory/AA16SLevelmap?SearchOption=1&amp;BLK=19&amp;STREET=Lor+7+Toa+Payoh&amp;pcode=310019&amp;STREETLIST=--&amp;MAIN_TRADE_CODE=0000Please+Select+Category%24&amp;Forward=&amp;FROMHOME=true&amp;Slvl=1&amp;SEARCHPANEL=1&amp;MAIN_TRADE_DESC_HI).

How Gaming Made Me: Love Firearms,"Something I wrote on how I came to appreciate the most used tool in any action game made today.A clip from the post:&gt;I wanted to know why some weapons dealt more damage than the others, why some had higher recoil and some didn’t kick as hard, and why are there so much freaking pointy things that go bang. You could say curiosity got the best of me and I wanted answers to all these questions. From then on, I knew that the M4 carbine was a shorter variant of the M16 rifle,  why the M1 Garand made a pinging sound after the last round, why the 1911 superior in terms of stopping power and operability versus the M9 Berreta.

My employer is moving me to Singapore...help?,"Hey guys,Posting this from a throwaway, as my co-workers know my regular reddit name, and don't want them knowing what's going on until things are final.There's a damn good chance I'm getting relocated to Singapore in the next month or two with my company. I'm a 27 year old white guy originally from California, but have lived in the Chicagoland area for the last 4 years. Prior to that, I spent time living in Colorado and Hawaii.I've perused the sidebar quite a bit, but unfortunately, I'm still left with questions. If you can help me, I'd be super happy, and may even buy you a beer once I get into town!1. Living? Where do you recommend? My offices are located near the corner of Telok Ayer and Cross St (I work in Finance, as an I.T. worker), so ideally I'd like to live no more than a 20 minute trip from there. Living in Chicago, our downtown area is lacking in the nightlife department, so I'd like to live somewhere that has a decent bar scene, but not far from work. My budget would be up to 1,100 SGD per month. Is it feasible to live on my own?2. Speaking of nightlife, any recommendations? I'm sure I'd like to hit up the touristy spots in the beginning, but I'm also open to most anything, except for clubbing.3. How much is a pint of beer? Google is telling me I'll need to sacrifice my first-born son and mortgage his soul to buy rounds at the bar. Is this true? Am I going to go broke buying shots for girls at the bar?4. How much of the country speaks English? What's the native tongue? I speak with Singaporeans daily, but these are I.T. people who speak English daily.5. The fun question: Girls? I'm a single guy, where do I want to go, so that I don't have to worry being taken advantage of for free drinks? haha6.

Singapore prides itself in its diversity and harmony, and always show videos and propaganda of Indians, Malay, Chinese etc. holding hands and declaring themselves as being one and being Singaporean. Then why is it that for things like this they feel the need to separate the Singaporean population on ethnicity? It's just hypocritical. They conveniently join all races together when it concerns something positive yet make a point to separate the races when it concerns something negative, as if saying 'Indians will always be Indians aren't Singaporean'.It just pisses me off sometimes at the two-faced nature that this country has.

Traveling to Singapore with several peanut allergy,"Hey r/Singapore, I'm a 28-year old consultant in the US that has been asked to travel to Singapore for 1-2 weeks for a project I'm staffed on.  Sounds like a pretty great opportunity (I'll even get to fly business!), but my international travel experience is very limited and I have a severe peanut allergy.  I've only ever been out of the U.S. once, and that was to Israel.  I've been fortunate to not have a reaction to Peanuts since I was first exposed at age 2, but still always test a 6 (anaphylactic) on the skin test and my IgE level was a 15.  I'm overly cautious when it comes to eating out, and have heard that Singapore is very well developed and can be accommodating to food allergies, as opposed to some of the other cities in the region (e.g. KL).  I'm thinking that I could get by by sticking to food in the hotel and in chain restaurants (e.g. subway, mcdonalds, etc).  Does anyone have any thoughts on this or experience dealing with a similar issue?  Any advice?  Thanks!EDIT #1: Title should be *severe* peanut allergy.

Hey guys! Need some more help about moving to Singapore,"First of all, many thanks for all the information posted in the last thread. It was very eye opening, and has made this whole transition a lot more realistic and easy.So, since the last time I've posted a thread here, I've actually received my offer letter and my work is in the process of securing my Employment Pass. I'll be in Singapore starting the 26th of January.With that said, it's now on to me to find housing.I need to do two things:1. Find short-term housing for a month, as this is included in my relocation package. My HR coordinator in Singapore has said it will be easier and cheaper for me to find a rented apartment than staying in a hotel. Normally, I'd say do whatever is easier, but my relocation expenses are capped at $S5000, including airfare. So, aside from shipping, I'm looking at about 2500 for accomodations for the month. Any recommendations? She recommended easyroommate and propertyguru, but I found those sites hard to navigate, and craigslist looks like a bunch of property agents trying to take as much money as they can from me. Ideally, I'd like a private studio for a month.2. Find permanent housing. In my last post, I think I said I was look at up to 1100 per month. In actuality, after speaking with my new co-workers out there, I'll be able to afford a range of 1500-2300 per month, comfortably. What can I do with that sort of range, realistically? Again, what I've looked at online doesn't really provide me a lot of information, other than property agents who are like sharks. From my own research, it looks like I'd want to live around the following MRT stations: Tanjong Pagar (Where I work), Dhoby Ghaut, Lavender, Clarke Quay, Raffles Place.

Are there any companies known for being better or having better service or something?I would love a card that will work when I go to Hong Kong and even Tokyo, but that's not a priority as I can always get a new card when I go to those cities.  Right now my priority is getting my emails and being able to BBM on my blackberry and calling people in Singapore.Any help would be appreciated.P.S., I have Skype on my phone but it dials a local number in the states and then goes through the Internet and makes the call that way.

Make a note: /r/singapore meetup on Friday 20th of January!,"Hey Reddiporeans!It's been a while since the last official [/r/singapore](/r/singapore) meetup in ~~Brewerks for Hallowe'en~~ Indochine so I think it's about time we organised another one.Friday the 20th seems like a good date to me since it's 2 weeks away (so nobody will be able to say they didn't know about it) and it's not so close to Chinese New Year that it interrupts with other functions and events you may have planned.The floor is open up to suggestions for a location so please voice your ideas! We will need somewhere that can accommodate at least 20 people. Indochine, Brewerks, Baden and Bar Bar Black Sheep worked pretty well, so if you know somewhere similar, convenient and not too expensive, then let us know.Leave a note here if you're planning on coming along too, so we can get an idea of how many we need to book for.On a personal note, this will be my last meetup (*sigh*) since I'm leaving SG and going home to Ireland a few days later. I hope we can make it a great night. :)",False,,,,

I am reaching out to you guys even though I havent met any one of you yet and have been a constant lurker out here. Please PM me if you are in a position to help out. My assurance is that this loan is not going to extend beyond 3 weeks.

question about car ownership in SG,"I'm relatively new to Singapore and I'm confused about some aspects of buying a car here (I'm not confused about how expensive it is though!).  When I look at used car sites and see information about a car that has, say, 5 years left on the COE, there appears to be some value to that COE should I buy the car and then sell before the end of the term of the COE.  Is my understanding correct that the govt will give you back whatever the residual value of the COE is?  If the auto loan principle is less than the residual value of the COE at the end of say, 3 years, is the case that I can get rid of the car and pay off the loan with the COE reimbursement?  If this is the case then it seems the equivalent to leasing a car in the states.  Any insight or guidance on this would be very helpful.

Alcohol situation for March 17th meetup,"CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN!!!No, no, really don't get your hopes up that high.  I do however have some updates/questions as to how I want to plan the alcohol for the next BBQ meetup in ECP.  First off, a little information:  I'm going through one of two delivery services found online - MabukMonkey or BeerCycles.  I'm currently going through what we will be needing and liaising with them to ascertain which is the best fit.  I am posing this so far ahead because I need to book the alcohol delivery within the next couple of days to make sure that we can get one of their weekend delivery slots.We're currently factoring the situation for about 30 people to show up, most of which, I assume, will be drinking to some degree.  There is one thing I wanted to gauge interest for, which will have a heavy influence on how much alcohol (specifically beer) I will need to order.  I'm wondering if anyone wants to take this meetup to the next level by having some official drinking games present.  What this would entail is a couple tables of beer pong ('beirut' for those from the motherland), flip cup (can/will be done on the sides of the pong tables - 8' is the standard size - 2.4384 meters for you crazies out there), assorted card games, power hour, and any other debauchery we can think of.  As far as I know, it's not illegal to play drinking games in public here, but please let me know if it is.  If we do want to do this, we will need a little more coordination in what we bring.  For example we will need 2-3 portable tables (for the beer pong if we so choose, although it might be more than anyone wants to bring - conversely I can also ask the deliveries if they can supply these).  I'll also have to order a ton more beer and cups.  Thus far, I'm planning for about 4-5 cases of beer, 4 bottles of liquor (2 vodki, 1 whiskey, 1 other - most likely rum or gin), 4 bottles of wine (2 red, 2 white), and 10 bottles of mixers (all sodas).  Along with some cups, ice, and coolers, it'll come out to about 20-25 a pop (again, factoring for thirty people).  Similarly, now's a good time to make it known what the preferred alcohol will be.  The budget above is using a mix of tiger/carlsberg as beer (I know, I know Hoobaga), but they're cheaper than the rest by a good amount (tl;dr the websites: Tiger/Carlsberg = $2.7 ; Heineken = 3.2 ; Hoegaarden/Stella = 3.7 ; Asahi = 3.8).  All of those are 320ml.Also, I'm unsure of how the best way to handle the payments is (is there a best way to make sure people pay for what they plan on drinking?  In my experience there isn't...).  They make it seem like we have to pay on delivery, but I'll have to look into it further.  If anyone has experience with these services let us know so we can figure out a good way to do this.  Needless to say, I'm really pumped for this meetup, it's got the potential for being biblical, compared to the epic it usually is.

Another tourist in SG. ,"So.... A few months ago I bought a very cheap ticket to Singapore on a Lufthansa one-day sale. I didn't plan much before leaving, the only thing I had sorted out before I left home was the hotel. I've been here 3 days now, and I think I'm about to fall in love with this place :) This is what I've done so far (not much really):Monday: Just checking out the CBD and the marina, trying not to die from heatstroke - I'm from the norternmost parts of Norway, we rarely get this kind of heat back home, and it's never ever been as humid as here. Mostly spent time in places with aircondition, I even took an otherwise unnecessary ride on the MRT just to cool down :) Had beer and food at Brewerkz (I found out about this place through r/singapore) before going back to the hotel.Tuesday: Overslept (I blame the jetlag, not the beer). Had ""breakfast"", took the MRT to the CBD, walked along the north side of the marina (past that floating stadium thingy and the helix bridge) to Marina Bay Sands to check out the view from the observation deck.  Still trying to get used to the heat. Went back to the CBD, through Boat Quay up to Brewerkz and had a beer (or was it three?). Went back to the hotel for a very much needed shower - and returned to the marina in the evening to take some nighttime photos of your beautiful skyline (we do not have anything remotly close to this in Norway) More beer at the hotel before getting to bed. (Yes, I do love beer...) Today: Woke up late again (guess I can't blame jetlag anymore...), went to Singapore Zoo, spent many, many hours there, loved it - again, back to the hotel for a quick shower and a short nap, went back to MBS to see the light show which I missed yesterday, and then walked back to the hotel (which is close to Lavender MRT) via Little India - had a late dinner at some place along the way..And here I am :)What's next? Any advice on what not to miss while in Singapore? I've heard a lot about the Night Safari - I've tried to check out their webpage, but for some reason the page won't load (I'm on a really slow internet connection) Anywhooo, I've been to Namibia and Botswana before, so I'm not sure if I really need to see this. What kind of animals do you get to see?I've seen lots of advertising/brochures about Sentosa, but I do not think that place is made for me - sounds kinda boring to be honest.. The only thing I possibly would want to see there is the underwaterworld(?) - unless you know of some hidden gems out there? I would like to take at least one day trip out of the country - I know that there are boats crossing over to Indonesia - but is there anything interesting to see at those places, or is it just resorts?I also wonder if it's possible to take a daytrip to Kuala Lumpur? AirAsia seems to have rather cheap tickets on offer, and if I take an early flight out, and a late flight back it seems to be possible... Any other daytrip suggestions?TL;DR: Yes I know it's a long post. Just read it, please. However, if you don't bother that's OK too.",False,,,,

Are Singaporeans particularly sy/empathetic towards sex offenders?,"I was looking through the comments on [this](http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=34294) story, in which the guy not only had child porn, he *peeped on children as a secondary schooler in the bathroom*. Still, the people there are mostly sympathetic towards him, and almost all of them put blame outside of the individual:&gt;Hmmmm... if companies now do a scan on the computers of their staff, I'm sure they'll find porn material (photos, videos etc) in most male staff. &gt;Teachers are human too... unless you now decree that male teachers must be Eunachs...&gt;What's wrong with our youths nowadays. The not so academically smart ones become gansters and slashers while the smart scholarly ones become pedophailes or walk naked in holland village for fun. Is there something wrong with the education system,society or parents upbringing?&gt;This story is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the quality of scholars...It makes one wonder about our selection process. Is the selection totally impartial and strictly based on results? I think it would make a lot of difference ""who knows you (your family)"" in the interview process...&gt;He very talent that why he have scholar and reach a very high level of sex drive to child porn. Sg need this type of talent.&gt;Think of it this way, MP can make BIGGER mistakes can still be seated with higher salaries ,why readers are not concern of these TOP gaman MP whom has make far more dangerous decisions ,yet we dont question them but for this young talent ,we want to gun him down?&gt;Anyway, I think he should have been given a 2nd chance for the 1st offence if that's indeed the REAL reason, and not that they missed it out. AND I think it could have been other scholarship, NOT MOE lah !! that's just sending the fox for training to guard the chicks...&gt;Let the man who have not watched or kept a single copy of pornography cast the first stone. This young man needs help. Can MOE do something to help him as it has given taxpayers money to develop him.&gt;Yeah...right now, almost all SG men who own or have access to a computer/s are guilty of having downloaded porn videos to watch. &gt;The milder ones can be found everywhere amongst our SG men. Filming upshot photos, snapping couples doing public display of affection, snapping photos of women in compromising positions from afar, Watching porn, downloading porn vids, from PC, handphone etc. What is Singapore coming to? A land of men obsessed with sex????!!&gt;Poor guy! As a mother myself, my heart goes out to him! He committed such acts out of folly, and his bright future might go down the drain! Could there be clemency shown to him, after the necessary queries etc? Hope that there would be a kind of amicable outcome.&gt;It could be quite stressful to be a scholar, some took stress in their stride, some took to other forms of stress relief. In this case, this guy went to an sexual perversion.  What abt the ladies? What kind of stress relief do these gals take? Do they come into somewhat as extreme as this guy?&gt;Didn't this simply shows that your ministry of education is sleeping. No wonder you people learn to speaks singlish and half-cook mandarin at school and your MOE claimed that to be bi-lingual. You must be a dafts and quitters to believe singlish and half-cook mandarin are bi-lingual. Can you people get your MOE not to sleep or day dream at work.&gt;This guy is extremely gifted--not just with academic intelligence, but also can do calligraphy and play the guitar and piano and he can sing. (I actually didn't even know about his musical and calligraphy talent until I read about it recently) He has worked so hard for many years to build a future for himself--it is truly a pity that he might lose everything because of some bad tendencies he has inside himself. &gt;Trust me, I was his ex-classmate and I am very sure that Jonathan earned his scholarship fair-and-square--through his merits instead of ""who you know"". Unlike many of my ex-classmates from HC Humanities Scheme, this guy is not rich and well-connected. He achieved so much so far by pure hard work combined with academic intelligence. I don't understand why you are questioning ""the quality of scholars""--according to your post. How many Singaporeans are as intelligent and talented as him?? That is the reason why he is given a scholarship and other Singaporeans are not. It is a great pity that all his brilliance might be wasted if he is put behind bars&gt;It's not too late to lend him some emotional support and encourage him to seek professional counselling. Let him know he still has friends who will not shy away from him and he may well have a chance to start life afresh.&gt;Thanks for your concern and compassion for him. Yup, that's what I did, I sent him an email 2 days ago expressing my sympathy for the position he's in. What he did was wrong, but it is not really for me to judge him--he is soon going to be judged by a court of law. &gt;Yeah, if he watched adult porn, none of us would care. Watching child porn is DEFINITELY wrong, and I understand that--it aids a very very bad industry. But it is not as bad as personally creating the child porn films, nor is it as bad as molesting/raping a child. That is why I hope he does not have to lose a chance at his career and lose a chance at a normal life. I know there's a high chance he will be sentenced to jail, but I hope he isn't (at least hopefully not for a long time). This young man has spent his whole life working towards his future--does he really deserve to lose everything?&gt;People are taking the opportunity to throw far more stones at Jonathan (Jon) than he deserves. Yes, I know that he did commit a crime, and as an aspiring lawyer, I full well know the importance of punishing individuals for the crimes they commit. But the fact that he did commit a crime doesn't give anyone else the right to throw any more stones or call for the heaping of more punishment on him than commiserate to his crime. While his watching and possessing of child porn videos does provide fuel to an undesirable industry, his watching and possessing is does NOT mean that he was going around attacking children. I know Jon personally and I can vouch that he wasn't assaulting any children.and so on, for several more pages.After the anti-paedo circlejerk on Reddit, my world just got flip-turned up-side down.

What is it like for a American to move and live in Singapore?  ,"My wife and I have been fascinated with Singapore for a long time now and we are having serious discussions about trying to move to and work in Singapore.  Unfortunately neither of us have any friends or family in Singapore and I was wondering if someone might be able to answer a few of our questions.  A little detail about us:  I am 30 years old, have a Finance undergraduate degree and an MBA.  My career has been spent in both the Insurance and Telecommunications with product management and product development as my focus.  My wife is also 30, she has a Biology undergraduate degree and a PHD in Immunology, she is currently working as a research tech for a local cancer center at our largest academic hospital.  While I was born in the US, my wife was born in China, and immigrated to the US in the early 1990s, she also speaks fluent Mandarin.  I completely understand the following questions are difficult to answer because they vary from person to person, but here is what we are interested to know: * Given our experience/qualifications, how hard would it be for us to find work in Singapore?   * Has anyone on this sub/reddit moved to Singapore from the US?  * What was the experience like?  * How was the transition?  * What did you learn?  * What mistakes did you make?  * What did you miss the most?  * How hard was it to make new friends?* Are there any different or “odd” laws that caught you by surprise? (I know about the no chewing gum thing, but similar laws)* How did the people in Singapore treat you?  * What have you done with your residency (are you still a US citizen or did you change your citizenship?)?* How has your lifestyle changed from America to Singapore?  * How did you find a job? * How do you feel now that you have made the move?* Are you happy?* What is it like raising kinds in Singapore?  * What are some of the largest problems facing Singapore today? (Crime? Poverty?)I know I am asking a lot of questions and I have many more.  If someone has the time and is willing to let me bombard you with more questions, please PM me.  It would be great to meet someone from or has experience in Singapore.

"EAST COAST PARK BARBECUE - AREA C PIT 7: MARCH 17, 4PM","**What: Barbecue!****When: March 17th, 2012; 4pm to late.****Where: East Coast Park, Area C, Pit 7. (Carpark C1)****Who: ~40 rambunctious Reddiporeans.**Food has been catered! Drinks have been ordered!Those of you who are particularly BBQ-proficient, I'd appreciate some people helping me with the actual cooking. Whether to share or for personal consumption (ya selfish prick), you're also welcome to bring your own food and drinks.*Music is a must!* To facilitate my screeching along with Queen's most sonorous of rock standards, someone bring along a pair of speakers. A football or frisbee might also be fun.[Here](http://i.imgur.com/D6UHq.png) is a map, with our barbecue pit demarcated by the red arrow. For reference, the East Coast Park McDonald's is at the ""Marine Cove"". Also, my phone number is 92373187 (David) so if, come the day of the barbecue, you have problems finding the pit you can give me a ring.Now, to the sticky issue of payment. To cover the cost of ordering everything, **you'll need to pay $40 if you're eating and drinking**. I've delegated the job of collecting the dinero to Bader. As you can imagine this may get incredibly confusing so if you guys could **please cooperate with Bader by finding him when you arrive and paying him**, that'd be great. Don't make me ""O$P$"" your home!As you're all well aware, the weather here is pretty capricious and I'm still working on a suitable wet weather program. Unsurprisingly, finding a sheltered pit that can accomodate 40 people has been a bit challenging. I suppose we can just keep our fingers crossed, but **if anyone has any suggestions for a wet weather BBQ plan, please PM me.****In either case, please check the r/Singapore main page at 2:30pm on March 17th where I'll post a confirmation or cancellation post once it's clear which way the weather is swinging.**[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pwd9j/east_coast_park_barbecue_gauging_interest/)[Drinks Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/q813d/alcohol_situation_for_march_17th_meetup/)",False,,,,

Hey redditors of Singapore. I have a question...,"Alright, in the upcoming iPad 3 launch in Singapore. I actually found a 'job' online for helping a person to queue and buy iPad3s. I will be paid $100 for each iPad I get but he will be giving me the cash to buy the iPads and on top of that, $200 as my pay since each person can buy 2 iPads. Sounds great but here's the catch, i have to leave my NRIC with him as well as signing a contract stating that i will only get my NRIC back if i get him the 2 iPads on that day or return him the money. In that short span of a few hours, I might be a victim of identity theft.So here's the question, is it even safe for me to leave my NRIC with him?

Some thoughts for PC geeks in Singapore.,"So recently I've been looking at hardware prices for a new PC, mainly from the downloadable pricelists at HWZ.

Even during the recent IT show, prices weren't much better. I can understand that the difference goes to SLS retailers which is small compared to US online retailers. Given Singaporeans' propensity to always look for the next lobang, do you think it's better for things to remain the same and let small Singaporean retailers prosper, or should distributors like ban leong and corbell step up the game to match global competitive prices with online retail for the benefit of the customers?",False,,,,

Not into resort beaches, or shopping centers (my travel base is already in Hong Kong), or clubbing kind of night life (night markets are fun though).2. I only have maybe 2-3 days tops on my own, so ideally the location I go to can be reached within half a day, by land/sea. My budget is fairly low also, so that's why I just want to travel locally rather than by air.I've heard Malacca (which looks like the kind of place I'd like to visit) as a suggestion, but wanted to see if you guys know of any less obvious hidden gems nearby?Thanks in advance!",False,,,,

They said that all foreigners working in Singapore need a work permit, which is obvious, they said that the Work Holiday Permit exists to provide students to gain permission to come and live in Singapore and work for some time.

Grammar in Singapore--please explain!,"I'm an American who's been working here a little over a year. I'm somewhat finicky when it comes to grammar, and I've noticed some puzzling usage of phrases/words that is consistent among locals.Examples:- ""Please revert back to me."" Isn't this redundant? Shouldn't it be ""Please revert to me""?- ""Do let me know if you have any questions."" Isn't 'do' implied? We might as well say, ""Do go to the market to pick up some groceries"" or, ""Do take your medication after a meal."" - [Referring to a future meeting] ""The agenda would be..."" instead of ""The agenda will be..."" since it should be future tense.- On another note, why do people have a tendency to overhyphenate words? Re-send? Co-ordinator? My intention isn't to criticize/criticise, but I was just wondering if these nuances are adapted from British grammar? Or is this what local children learn in school? How much grammar is taught in primary/secondary school? I can already predict that this post will be downvoted into oblivion, but I am hoping for a few reasonable answers anyway. :)**EDIT: To be fair, a question for locals: What grammatical nuances do you hear from Americans/Brits/Aussies/other foreigners that perplex you?**",False,,,,

From the [ACM website](http://www.acm.org.sg/exhibitions/eventdetail.asp?eventID=784):&gt; Charles Darwin was surprised to receive an essay from Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858 with a very similar theory on natural selection. Because Wallace’s original manuscripts did not survive, there is no definite proof of when they were sent or received. Later writers have suggested that Darwin lied about the facts of their correspondence, and the matter has been shrouded in controversy. John van Wyhe will set the record straight on this famous episode in science history.&gt;About the speaker: Dr van Wyhe is a senior lecturer in the departments of biological sciences and history, National University of Singapore. He is the founder and director of Darwin Online, fellow of the Linnean Society of London, scientific associate of the Natural History Museum, London, and member of the British Society for the History of Science. His research has challenged several long-standing misconceptions about Darwin, including the traditional view that Darwin was afraid to publish his theory, or that he kept it secret for 20 years. Van Wyhe published four books on Darwin in 2009, the bicentenary of his birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of the Species. And...

High School in Singapore [Advice Needed],"I am a 15 years old Indonesian who will have high school in Singapore. Previously, I was given an option to choose a high school on either Australia (Melbourne) or Singapore. I choose Singapore because I heard it have better education (competitive environment), it have different kinds of people (so I can prepare for a global environment), and it is closer to Indonesia anyway. Tell me, does all the things that I heard are true? Like is it true that Singapore have a competitive environment? Or is there something wrong with Singapore system of education so that you would highly don't recommend me to go there? Also, I have another concern. I have a high expectation on my English education, but my Australian friend fear that I might adopt Singaporean accent which he say is worst (no insult intended sorry, it's just culture differences). Should I worry about this?And is there any places of vacation that you can recommend me? I like quiet and empty place where I could see the sky.Lastly, are there any Indonesians that live in Singapore? I know there's a lot of tourist but is there a lot of Indonesians that take high school there? Because probably I want to find some to show me around Singapore so I can adapt quickly.This is my first post, and I am really concern about my future so please help me. Sorry for the long post, and sorry if there's any mistake.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT:One more question; is there a community of rock n' roll somewhere in here? Because there's none in Indonesia (kids here love One Direction and such. Fuck that. Hail AC/DC and Van Halen) and it is one of the reason why I am moving; to form a band. (it's hard to form a band on my generation).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT II: You guys have been really helpful. Some even message me with statistic of comparison between local school and international school. Frankly, I didn't expect to get this much of helps, especially when it is my first post. But I get a lot, and even stuffs that are crucial to me. I am choosing an International School in Singapore because it have a good education, it would make me creative, I would adapt well by helps of friends from my own country and I will also adapt well to people from different countries, and I can make choice about my subject which is crucial for my universities.I didn't choose local school because I don't like the robot-teaching method as it will bound me (as I am more of a creative person), it is hard to get in there as I am not a Singaporean, and I am not familiar with the curriculum so I am not really sure.I didn't choose Australia because it is far, Singapore have better education (IMO), and I wouldn't be as discipline as I am if I studied in Singapore (doesn't mean that they're lazy).Please correct me if I am wrong, or if you have a better suggestions.

What I have learned in two weeks as an American in Singapore,"1. People do not like to speak with you in public. I now understand that Singaporeans view this as a breach of their privacy? Where I am from, in the US it is quite normal for people to say hi to one another. I thought NYC was anti-social, but wow Singapore wins. Some guy laughed at me when I waved and said hi to him while running outside. I learned that I must respect others and keep to myself.2. Alcohol is expensive. I really cannot imagine getting drunk too often in Singapore unless someone points me to a cheap place.3. It seems that Singaporeans are brand and social conscious. Your standing in life and the brands you wear really make a difference while talking to others.4. A lot of people are quite active and healthy. This has motivated me to get outside more and run. I often see people running or engaging in other physical activity despite the heat.5. Traffic is really amazing. Very few traffic jams and nothing as bad as the US.So just a few observations I have made while here. By the way, anyone ever want to meet up and grab lunch so I will have someone new to speak with?

Some people who don't drink are definitely going to show up.For people who do want to drink, bring your own drinks, share a bottle with some friends, or just come with no drinks and we'll get whoever is interested to pool together money and order drinks from somewhere like [mabuk monkey](http://www.mabukmonkey.com/#/menu/4554873329) with the total funds available. The garden closes at 12am, so we'll have to leave before then (to round 2 of drinks, perhaps).----If you are coming,Please state:1. Whether you'll be able to make it on time or will be late 2.

Foreigner in Singapore with Cultural Q's...,"Hey Redditporeans...I'm an American currently vacationing in Singapore with my husband.  First time in any Asian country.  It is beautiful and we are really enjoying it!  But we have come across some cultural questions that I can't find the answers to in any guide book and was hoping you guys could help.  We would appreciate it!!  1.  Is high tea a real ""thing"" Singaporeans do or is it for tourists?  We had it today, we enjoyed it, but wondered if those around us were tourist or locals.2.  Is the price of alcohol kept artificially high for a reason?  Is it highly taxed on import which causes the price to inflate?  Or some other reason?3.  What time should we be eating meals?  We had dinner a little before 9pm today (22:00) and the restaurant seemed to be clearing out as we sat down.  We will eat when we are hungry, obviously, but I'm just wondering what is etiquette.  4.  We are staying in the Orchard Road area and haven't seen any police, fire trucks, ambulances, etc.  Haven't heard any sirens either.  Are we just not being observant or do accidents not exist here?  :)Thanks again, sorry if any of these questions come off ignorant.

How to afford a home in Singapore?,"Hi, I asked this question in r/personalfinance, but I would also like to hear the opinion of some Singaporeans.I am local in my mid 20s and have been working for about a year since I got out of college. Me and my gf are trying to buy an apartment around the same time we intend to get married (next year). Income is about $3500 a month and my gf is at $5500 a month. No debt at all as I got a scholarship through college, and a very stable job (government affiliated). I have about $50k cash total and she has slightly more. Problem is, land in Singapore is ridiculously expensive. My 3 options are: HDB, Condo and Private land.HDBs cost about $300k-700k, depending on location obviously. Thing is, the “leases” on such flats are only 99 years, meaning that the government has the option of taking it back at the end of it. Also, new flats are allocated on a ballot, meaning it’s pretty difficult to get a new flat in a good location. And buying an older flat means more of the 99 year lease has been used up etc.Apartments and condos are more expensive, ranging from about $800-$1500 psf, making prices for a 3 room condo $800-$1.5M+. I am currently more inclined towards this option as I feel like it makes more sense investment wise. I am looking to buy something in the $800k - $1M range. Bear in mind, location is quite essential as I do not own a car (Fuck COE). However, the cost of paying $1M is pretty daunting considering that might keep me in debt for the next 30 years. I did some basic calculations and at a 1% interest rate, we would be paying $2-3k a month. Our living expenses are pretty low so that is affordable, but it doesn’t leave much for savings.So if you are still reading this chunk of text, what should someone in my situation do?

the chilli,"Ok, here is the Singapore Reddit Chi-double l-i recipe you asked me for:.Pick one or more elements from each category, or substitute something to give the same effect:.1.

Sauce base:  Canned tomatoes, pureed bell peppers. .I've also used sweet potato as a sauce base, but that doubles up with another category, ""sweet""...4. Fillers:  Ground beef, ground lamb, black beans, kidney beans...5. Liquids:  Use a GOOD broth, not shit. Any kind (I used chicken in the chilli for the meetup)..Beer and wine do OK too, but beer doubles as a bittering agent...6. Basic flavorings:  Cumin, corriander, cinnamon, Worchester Sauce. .Go heavy on the cumin and corriander...7. Sweet:  Raisins, carrots, sweet potato, apples, cider, fresh corn (especially scrapings from a raw cob), or molasses. ..8. Bitter:  Oregano, thyme, turmeric, beer, cilantro...9. Umame:  Mushrooms, soy sauce, MSG...10. Heat:  Fresh or dried chilies, tobasco sauce, etc....Directions:.Fry the flavor vegetables in the fat (put peppers in first, then onion, then garlic, based on how quick they cook). Throw in lots of your dried flavors (cumin, corriander). Add your mushrooms now too if you ate using them..Flavor the meat (salt, pepper, more of the dried spices) and brown in more fat. You can add the meat to the fried veggies now or later. Pour some of your liquids over it for more flavor, and evaporate it off..Add your liquids to the fried veggies and scrape the pan. Add your sauce base and other ingredients and cook it down to how you like it, stirring to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pot. .The end.",False,,,,

June 23rd: Reddit Global Meetup,"Hello, fellow Reddiporeans and foreign talent! I've gone ahead and reserved 40 seats under the name 'David' on **June 23rd, Saturday, 6pm at Brewerkz** for all of us.If you're having problems finding the place, you can contact me at *9237 3187*.If you've never been to Brewerkz, you can find it at the following address:&gt;Riverside Point&gt;30 Merchant Rd&gt;Singapore 058282The nearest MRT station would be Clarke Quay MRT. Check the maps in the station and get yourself to Riverside Point. If you keep to the side of the building that's against the river, you can't miss Brewerkz.

As Dreamwaltzer said, most food dishes are $20-30 and most beers are $10-15 so plan your ATM trip accordingly.If you're a chronic lurker who isn't sure we're cool, I assure you that we're all equally awkward and we'll all have a grand ole' time regardless. Join us for delicious food and beers! I'm talking to you, *Sharon from my office.*As for post-Brewerkz plans, Clarke Quay is just across the river so we can head there where I can throw a glass of gin in someone's face in a drunken haze (up yours, Chris).

Moving to singapore after college (E.E.) ?,"Hi, I realize that immediately after graduating college will probably be my last time where I have no commitments and no obligations to a institution or person. I should be graduating with no student debt with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering in the near future. I would have at least one internship with a fortune 500 company under my belt. I am a U.S./German national. I don't speak any Mandarin/Cantonese.Do you think I would be able to get an engineering job in Singapore immediately after college? Is visiting Singapore on a tourist visa to find a job the best approach?Would it be much more desirable if I had a year of experience working in the U.S.? Would the jobs available be well paying, or just enough to get by?I would probably still be interested in living in Singapore for a year if I was paid ""modestly"", just to try something completely different.Is there a significant expat community of my age group?If anyone is aware of a program that allows me to get a graduate degree in electrical engineering studying part of the time in Singapore and part of the time in England/U.S./Canada/Germany/Austria/Switzerland please let me know.Thanks a lot!",False,,,,

I also got a cup of lychee sugar cane drink.

Is it reasonable to take a taxi (at least in one direction)? Can I schedule a regular taxi every morning? Will the driver wait for me to install a car seat? It's a bit long to walk, since I will need to walk back afterwards to get to work.

I'm moving to Singapore to be with my loved one which we will eventually marry.1.  I have two cats and am not sure how feasible it is to bring them over.  Is it easy and worth it?

I've never driven on the left side before.4.  How's the golf?  I know it's expensive. Are there any decent and cheap courses in the city? Or will I be traveling to Batam or Malaysia every weekend?5.

Why do Singapore and surrounding countries ban Medical Marijuana under penalty of death?,"Hi guys... I've gotten very interested in medical marijuana (Cannabis) recently since my father passed away from cancer.I have learnt that cannabis was made illegal in the US due to misinformation, corporate interest, yellow journalism and racism. Harry J Anslinger actually went up to congress and said ""Marijuana causes negros to look white men in the eye, step on white man's shadow and look at a white woman twice""But ever since the late 1990's, scientist began to discover that Cannabis is not harmful to a person, in fact it is the exact opposite, Cannabis is actually healthy for you if taken the right way. Scientists have even showed that cannabis have the ability to reduce tumors since back in 2003.There is even a news report done on a boy named ""cash Hyde"" who had suffered from brain cancer but was cured using cannabis oil.So in hindsight, if cannabis was legal, my father would have suffered a lot less or even still be alive right now.Anyway, I am very sure that our multi million dollar ministers would have known about this.

Filmmaker looking for work/ sponsorship ,"Hello Reddit world.   I am a 26 year old film maker with an addiction to [traveling](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/hitchhiker42/).  I have been traveling the world for months and recently took a few jobs in SF that are now caring me back over seas. (working in Portland in July then Cambodia in August)   I'm looking for something in September in Asia or Australia.   I have my work visa for Australia but have to claim it by September (or reapply for it) and would love to explore the land down under and help out with film around there.  I recently did a stent in Singapore and would love to look into getting a work sponsorship. I would love to help out with corporate videos or feature films (film crew does not technically need a visa if the Ministry is notified... as of a few months ago... I think... and I'm willing to sign a contract for a good company) I love Singapore because its a solid central location to explore a lot of Asia, and its a good melting pot of culture from all around the world. About me as a filmmaker:  I have been working on movies for a while now. I went to High school for filmmaking, then carried that over to a degree from vancouver film school.  I have worked on everything from short films to features, reality tv to documentaries. I have a passion that drives me to keep doing all of this.  I work hard and efficient, and keep a smile on my face (normally make a joke or 3) even after the days hit the 20 hour mark.    Below is my reel and a few links to my work and IMDB. * [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3707727/)* [Reel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGA0fPXcR6w)* [Hostel Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YpsrCbiM0M)* [Personal Promotion video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veeeyTFMNkE)* [Current Project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhDMAm5tRAQ)* [Editing your footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pq_B-oBCVU)* [Shot and edited in 24 hours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTdg0V2xQ4I)My gear list●   1x Panasonic AF100 •    1x Olympus 14-150 4-5.8, 1x Nikon 50mm 1.8•    3x Batteries●   1x Fluid Head Tripod●   1x Shotgun Mic●   1x Nikon to M4/3 mount and Canon to M4/3 mount●   1x Go Pro w/ chest mount, LCD backpack, 3x Batteries●   Editing on Premier Pro I would love to get back out of the states and keep exploring the world while I'm still young. :) I'm booked until I finish filming this documentary in Cambodia (August 31st) and would love to start the process for any visa's (in Singapore).

Better Housing Guide for Expats on /r/Singapore?,"I was looking through the guide (while answering yet another ""I'm moving to Singapore"" post) and noticed it seems a little outdated:&gt; Should you choose to rent a HDB flat, you will find that the going rate starts from $800 for a 5-room flat in the outlying areas (eg Jurong, Pasir Ris) and about $1,100 for one closer to town. Downgrade to a 3-room (a puny 500 sq ft) or 4-room (800 sq ft), and you can find yourself paying as little as $700. But that is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.I think the days when you could rent an entire flat for $700 are long over. Also, the listings in the Property Guide show listings like ""The Sail @ Marina Bay"", which probably costs more than what some of our newly-employed foreigners can afford. Now, I don't go for reddit meetups, but surely not *all* of our expats are investment bankers. Any of you guys have better recommendations for housing rentals?Also, at the risk of sounding un-PC, isn't ""expat"" code in Singapore for ""white people working in management""?

In a few months, the date is not not finalized yet, I intend to take a vacation there and see the sights. I'm planning on about 2 weeks to a month. It depends on how much of my money I'm willing to divert when the time comes. My question is, what is the Singaporean attitude toward black people? It's unfortunately one of the sad things about being black that everywhere you go, people tend to carry a lot of stereotypes about your intelligence, social class, and attitude. So travelling as a black person can be... uncomfortable. However I never ever let that stop me from enjoying myself and learning new things and I never step on anyone's toes. Before traveling I always study as if I'm preparing for a final exam. I just like to be prepared so that I'm not shocked and knocked off balance. Please be frank and honest with me, I don't take any offense. Is Singapore a place where I have to be extra careful not to offend people because of my ""race""? As a person of darker skin, are there any cultural sensitivities I need to be gentle around? I never judge a place. As you can probably tell from this question, I'm used to quite a bit of negative treatment so it doesn't bother me. I just want to make sure that if there's anything to worry about, I can navigate it smoothly without ruining some Singaporean native's day or my trip.I know this is a weird question to ask... and I hope I haven't offended anyone by asking.EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback.

"Any NUS students, past or present, care to help a noob out?","I'm a student who just matriculated in School of Computing and I'm having a lot of trouble with my modules. Tomorrow is the first day that new students like me can start bidding for our modules through the CORS system, but I'm not sure whether I'm going to be making the right decisions.My questions are:* What's the difference between Breadth: Electives outside of my faculty (i.e. School of Computing) and Unrestricted Electives? According to the [degree requirements](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/nusbulletin/SoC/UG/degreqs.html) here, I require 8 MCs for Breadth. On the other hand, [over here](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/cs_cs_2011_12.html) it says I require 20 MCs for Unrestricted Electives. Descriptions to both are basically saying the same thing (outside faculty, exploring interest outside area of student's major, etc.), so what's the difference?* I'm a Computing major but I'm interested in doing Philosophy. If I bid for a Philosophy module (successfully), does that count as Breadth or Unrestricted Electives?* On top of that, since this is my first semester ever, is it recommended for me to clear the Singapore Studies module and General Education modules first, or should I do the Mathematics and Science modules first as stated in the degree requirements in the second link above?* If I intend to take Philosophy as a minor, should I take Intro to Philosophy in my first semester, or leave it till later semesters and do something more related to my major first?I'm sorry for all the questions.

Anyone else notice a decrease in flags out this National Day?,"I thought folks were just late this year but it's only a week to go and Serangoon is quite flag-less - maybe 5 flags for every 50 households.I know that flag hanging has been on a downward trend since - by my estimation - at least 10 years ago but this year seems especially flag-less. I remember 20+ years ago, a flag-less flat was definitely the exception rather than the rule.According to taxi driver political science, it's because Singaporeans are upset with the government and the PAP. Hence, a drop in patriotic sentiment. But hey guys!, governments come and go; Singapore is Singapore!I guess what I'm saying is: Get out the flags!Who's with me?",False,,,,

I think I was mistaken for a prostitute last night.,"So last night, I went to Bt Timah with my friends for supper. There were about 7 of us so we took two cars out. When we left, it was about 1am and we dropped a few people off at their respective houses. Since I lived in Woodlands, which was the furthesr away from everyone else, I decided to just take a cab from Yew Tee as they were all in that area and I didn't wanna trouble anyone.So we waited along Old Woodlands Road (the area where that dog daycare thing is at) for my cab as it would just be a straight road home. The two cars waited with me, until I got into a cab because yknow.. Stranger Danger, don't get raped situation. I got out of the car and while waiting, talked to my friend in the front car through the window, leaning in as we conversed so I don't get hit by other oncoming vehicles.A little while later, a patrol car drives by and stops slightly after us. Cops came out and screened me, asking what I was doing out so late for a young girl of barely 20. Explained to them that I was simply talkin to my best friend while waiting for a cab home, they took my details and went off.My friends in the second car looked very amused while the ones I was talking to asked me ""So how much?"". It was pretty damn funny and there's not really a point to this story. I just wanted to share an amusing experience with a bunch of strangers I met on the internet.Tl;dr: Cops screened me for talking to my friends through a car window on the roadside at one in the morning.",False,,,,

I want to work in Singapore. Any tips?,"At the end of 2013 I'm planning to finish a degree in International Business with a minor in Economics.

With that in mind, I really want to get a job working in Singapore. I've travelled there many times and I really enjoy the place. It's close enough to home (Australia) and the food and people are fantastic. I also like its proximity to other parts of Asia, which I've travelled through extensively.

Is the job market good at the moment for foreigners in white collar industries? Ideally, I'd be working with some sort of multinational firm. My study path, grades, references and experiences should make me very competitive in interviews. My area of expertise will be in Supply Chain + Logistics, Economics and general business analyst work. What chance do I have of gaining employment and will I enjoy it? Is the pay decent enough for recent graduates? I know this all seems a bit wishy-washy at the moment.

(www.nikoi.com)Unfortunately xxx came down with bacterial dysentry yesterday and the doc has advised against travel. The resort offers 0% refund but does allow us to transfer the booking.

However, the couple will have to shell out about S$200 for ferry return from Spore-Bintan and another S$180 for transfer to Nikoi island. Full boarding (all 3 meals plus unlimited watersports activities) is S$90 per person per day as well.It's a tad steep but its the number 1 rated place on TripAdvisor and we were looking forward to splurging a bit on our annual holiday but will have to give it up now :( we just want to try and see if someone we know can enjoy it instead.Please do reply in case you know anyone who is keen.Thanks a tonxx",False,,,,

SingTel home broadband - horrendous network and service?,"Been here a week and could find why Singaporeans love to hate SingTel. The fixed line home broadband connectivity is so horrible! I bet it's a lot better service in Tanzania. Even in a third-world country like India one gets a decent enough service at comparable rates. Upon digging a little into the issue it looks like DNS servers by SingTel are the cause. They time out very often. Users constantly get a 'host not reachable' page. The 2wire ADSL modems too seem to be hopeless as shit. Any inherent problems with it? Sites like google.com /youtube are not accessible! Shit's that fucked up! SingTel service folks seem to have no clue about what that is. ""please restart ah! it would work!"" is the response. I guess those who are here for a short while are just forced to put up with this shit considering that prepaid mobile broadband is pricey. And I guess that sucks even more. /rant",True,0.6606544256210327,Technology,0.964823305606842,Infrastructure

So, I think I will do just fine over there too.I spent quite a bit of time in Aus to look for the job that I am interested in but had no luck.

Question: would r/singapore's members be interested in a subscription shaving supply service?,"Hey guys,I am trying to gauge Singaporeans' interest in a service that supplies shaving items on a periodic basis.  For example, we could send razors shaving cream, and other items to your address so you would not have to run to the store to resupply.  We would have to be competitive on price, otherwise the value to the consumer obviously decreases.Let me know if you would have interest and, if so, feel free to message me with any questions.

New to Singapore: US Shopping Equivalents in Singapore,"Hi all - I'm new here and would really like some local shopping advice.

Next up, where are good places to get produce and MEAT?

I've been dying for some good meat lately. Hope y'all can shed some light on this.

I wanted to know what the older generation thinks of the younger ones, from a more local context.As a 23 year old, I feel that I get to see some of both worlds.  The younger generation (I find) are very disrespectful to their elders, and generally don't really care about what would amount to respect in the house.  For example, they'd use their phones at the dinner table with the family, or even listen to music while eating with the family.

Follow Up from Subscription Shaving Service: Figured out pricing and product mix.,"Hey Everyone,Want to first thank all of you for your input to my original question in regards to the original question I had, link below:http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zibqw/question_would_rsingapores_members_be_interested/I have figured out a nice set of products I can bundle together and send out on a monthly basis to meet everyone's shaving needs.  These would include:1) Disposable 3 blade razor cartridges (handle will be sent in first month)...Dorco2) Deodarant/anti-perspirant....Old Spice3) Shaving cream...Barbasol4) Face moisturizer with SPF 15....great quality generic I useIncluding 7-8 day shipping from time of order, it would cost around S$28 on a monthly, recurring basis.  I eat quite a lot of the costs in the first month by giving away the handle for free and adding its weight to the package, but the idea would be to have it paid off over time by people continuing to use the service.My question is, would you guys still be interested in this service at this price point?  Are you interested in all of these products?  I can add other 'bolt-ons' (condoms, etc) later, but don't want to get out of scope too soon here.Any and all feedback is much appreciated.TLDR: S$28/month for razors, deodarant, shaving cream, face moisturizer.

22nd September Reddit Meetup,"So according to people on the r/singapore facebook group, some people want a meetup to happen!Therefore, a meetup shall happen. This is going to be like the previous one at the botanic gardens where folks just bring food and drinks, and $ to buy more drinks. We spend the night eating/drinking/talking, that's it. Super chill atmosphere where you can meet people and get sloshed (if you choose to). For those of you who are new here, Singapore does not have any open container laws. I know the NUS meetup is on the 14th and everyone is welcomed, but one can never have too many meetups (also this would be great for people busy on fridays, or feel awkward going to a campus for a meetup). This is happening on F1 Saturday and is great for people who have nothing to do then(the big race is on Sunday, so don't worry). The only problem now is this: WHERE SHOULD THIS HAPPEN???If no good ideas come up for where this should happen (a park or somewhere we can chill openly) then we shall go back to the botanic gardens. Preferably this shouldn't happen at gardens by the bay, because the f1 race nearby would (probably) cause some crowding in the area. I have an idea where we can have our post-meetup party if people are keen, but we'll talk about this there. Please post your ideas as to where we should go and whether you're interested in coming (I know this makes no difference - but just do it). ",False,,,,

Games like DayZ, Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, Borderlands 2 and Garrysmod (Trouble in Terrorist Town &amp; Morbus) are examples. It's difficult to find a server, let alone people, to record our sessions with, when everyone else is off playing Dota 2 or League of Legends.Usually, I would end up hosting, and my friends would join in. This wouldn't be much of a problem in small, story-driven, co-op games, like Borderlands 2 or Left 4 Dead 2. But in bigger mass-multiplayer games, like Mount &amp; Blade or Garrysmod, we often run out of things to record.We're a small party of four to five people, so we're hoping to grow that number to around 10 or 15 with online people that share the same interests as us. We have a Mumble server for our gaming needs too.We usually play on the weekends, or sometimes during the weekdays, if we have enough people.We play a variety of games, we're currently trying to finish up Borderlands 2 at the moment, with a little of Mists of Pandaria, Torchlight 2 and Guild Wars 2 on the side.If you're interested, leave me a reply or a private message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.",False,,,,

Skipping national service. ,"Hello /r/Singapore. I'm going to be serving my NS term in less than two years time. However, I have no desire to serve for a country I have no liking for.

So far, I've been living in Europe since birth and have accustomed myself to the western culture, the one I grew up in.

I have a question and a message from the doctor,"Greetings all. I am an international elective student from Aus and have been in Singapore for about two weeks now. I subscribed to this sub even before I left as a way of getting the inside knowledge and have an idea about what to expect. I have of course therefore, tried many of the delicacies listed and visited quite a few of the places suggested so am very grateful for that. It is a truly marvellous city and I cannot get over how amazing the transport system is. And the food, oh gosh, the food! It's so cheap and so good! Suffice to say, I am having to make extra trips to the gym to try and compensate. While I think I am starting to get an idea about how things work, there are some things that still confuse me/things that I don't understand so am hoping that you could enlighten me (or 'alight' as the recording says on the MRT). Also, yes, I notice this will be stuff coming from an outgroup member and a lot of people will automatically go on the defensive but I swear that I mean no disrespect or offence. (I have noticed a few members here write with a swathe of social psych terminology)1) Has people adapted to the climate such that you guys don't sweat when you go outside anymore? I am convinced that your amazing mass transit system was built with the sole purpose of avoiding stepping out into the hot and humid weather. 2) As per the whole Singapore is a 'fine' city theme, many offences are finable including littering, jaywalking and eating/drinking in the mrt stations/trains. The last one doesn't quite make sense to me since this seems the only time you can have a 'rest' as you go from one place to another. Can there be any circumstances where you are able to have a drink? E.g. to take medications etc.? Also, with regards to the jaywalking, I have been informed that it depends on the area (e.g. never in the inner city) and time of day with this 'crime' as I have seen many do it whilst I feel compelled to wait for the little green man under the sweltering heat. And finally, smoking. I was under the impression that this was a finable offence as well but I see many people smoking just about 1m away from signs saying no smoking so is that all that is needed? Or is it one of those few offences that are not really enforced too much?3) I notice that overall, people have a tall, lean build. Is the leanness and the musculature due to the NS that most males have to go through? Or is it just a blessing of genetics, just like closed angle glaucoma is a common curse over here. 4) With the recent Amy Cheong saga, there is the whole racism issues springing up. It seems like the basic wheels of Singapore turn on the back of foreign workers, many of whom appear to be Indian. Do you feel that there is a reliance on these workers? Is there a feeling there they are 'taking your jobs' type of attitude? I know there are already establish triumvirate of Indian, Malay and Chinese and I wonder how that plays into all of it as well. Anyway, these are just some questions that I had. Thanks in advance for your answers and again, I meant no offence. I am just very curious and I guess I feel safer broaching these here behind the veil of anonymity. ",False,,,,

Share your Ghost Stories here!,"I'll start the ball rolling with stories from my old school, the notoriously haunted, St Patrick's School.But first, just a little history about my school. It was built in 1933 and during the war, it served as a British hospital and later, a Japanese Imperial Airforce Headquarter. As you might imagine, lots of people had their untimely deaths within the grounds, including rumours of a massacre in the chapel.**Moving Statues**My friend was having a camp there at night and as he was walking past the mother mary statue next to the canteen. the Mother Mary statue actually moved and turned to look at him. my friend was shocked and he ran off. Another story was about a group of scouts coming back from night walk at night. As they walked pass the De La Salle statue, it suddenly turned and pointed at them. All freaked out and ran like crazy. **Haunted Painting**This was one of the stories passed down through generations. There was this old painting in one of the classrooms in the lower secondary block, level 1. It was a picture of fishermen i think. One day, the DM and a teacher wanted to go in. They opened the door and suddenly felt a strong wind blowing out, even though the classroom windows and doors were all closed. The DM went in and saw the pictures moving. He damn near had a heart attack. A priest was called in and he confirmed that the classroom was filled with evil spirits that didn't want to leave, and didn't want anyone in. They did an exorcism and I think the picture was removed and sealed away  in the armory of the school. **Little Boy**My friends and I were playing cards and gambling outside the squash court when we noticed a boy running towards the science block. Curious, my friend went to take a look but didn't see the boy. We went back to playing cards when we saw the same boy running towards the science block again in the same direction. This time we went together but again to no avail. After that we heard that a boy died last time falling down from the 3rd story of the science block. He was trying to retrieve his kite. ****There are more stories I have about possession and Japanese soldiers marching in and out of classrooms but I'll let you guys have a go first.",False,,,,

Frustrated.....Should I stay here? Will I ever be accepted?,"I'm increasingly getting frustrated living here. I feel like becoming increasingly negative and cynical after listening to all the things people say about foreigners and Indians and Chinese in particular.The last straw was when recently I was in the car of one of my superiors of the company I work in. And this guy was someone I looked up to. And in front of me he used terms like Permanent Rubbish and Foreign Trash like I was supposed to agree with him. He was complaining like the typical thing you find on facebook and the Asia One forums. Useless foreigners drive up property prices, he even said that we should never have given these foreigners any PR or Citizenship. He said we should be like Saudi Arabia and UAE where we just bring in the workers to do the dirty jobs and send them packing once they've outlived their usefulness. This is a educated, wealthy guy who wears a $10,000 watch and lives in a upper end condo. As someone who is considering making Singapore my permanent home (i.e citizenship), this hurt me.I'm an ultra liberal, I am all for a united world even a world where there are no countries. Maybe this is due to my liberal California University education, but why is it so hard to find people who think alike, why am I looked down upon even by the educated, why do people use terms like trash and rubbish to describe me.The other day I made a call to a real estate agent  and he promptly said no Indians allowed. I looked at my Singaporean friend next to me and he said ""well its their apartment, if they don't want to rent an apartment to an Indian its their choice"".I feel like the racism is too prevalent, I've travelled all over and I've never experience any explicit racism other than Singapore. And if I was ever subjected to racism in the US,UK or Philippines I know I would have 10 locals to back me up. But in Singapore somehow racism is understandable because of the ""situation"".I want everyone to get along, I want to live in a place where nobody sees my race at all. I lived years in countries where the fact that I was Indian was never brought up, I was just another guy. I feel like getting angrier to, I don't want to become negative living here, I'm an optimist all about world peace, that is my biggest worry, that I become racist too. So help me out r/Singapore, tell me things are improving. Singapore is my dream country, I chose it over countries that even Singaporeans want to emigrate to, tell me I didn't make a mistake.

Brown guy coming to Singapore--what should I expect?,"Hi guys,I'm sure you get questions like this all the time in this subreddit, but here goes.

I'm thinking of coming to Singapore for a summer internship with a financial company. What should I expect?Specifically, I have four questions:First, renting: I've heard that some Singaporean landlords are racist and refuse to rent to Indians. Is this true? For the record, I'm really Americanized (read: wear deodorant, don't cook smelly curry, don't push and shove other people in queues), but would that matter to a potential landlord?Secondly, language: I understand that Singaporeans speak English, but would it be a good idea for me to brush up on, say, Mandarin before coming? (I learned some in high school, but it's a bit rusty at the moment).Thirdly, dating: is it true that Singaporean girls/women only want light-skinned guys and wouldn't give a brownie like me a second glance? I have a pretty conservative attitude towards dating (looking for exclusive, monogamous relationships, no one-night-stands or drunken hookups). Is Singapore a good place for a guy with my outlook to find romance?Lastly, socializing: What do Singaporeans do for fun?

"London to Australia without flying - made it to Singapore, any advice or help on the final crossing? ","Firstly, I just set up a reddit account and don't really know what I'm doing here - please let me know if I'm doing this wrong (check these out to see http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151165253226234&amp;set=a.10150697281881234.398569.526826233&amp;type=3&amp;theater and http://www.facebook.com/spandex/posts/10151306277877534?comment_id=26231760&amp;ref=notif&amp;notif_t=feed_comment) I'm a former student sitting in a bit of a limbo at the moment - I finished my final semester abroad in Copenhagen in May and since then have been spending the rest of the year traveling before I start work in the new year. I have no real plans other than vaguely making my way towards home (Australia) and a desire to do it without flying. It started off as a rough idea - Australia is the world’s largest island, has some of the world’s strictest customs, quarantine and border protection policies, no commercial ferry or boats entering other than super expensive cruise liners and, therefore, has very few options for getting in other than by plane. After a while though, it became somewhat of an obsession. Thus far, I:* left London in July in a Vauxhall Agilla 1.2L shitbox with 3 friends driving across 15 countries and 15,000kms to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia where we donated the car to charity (http://www.facebook.com/longwaylost); * got down into China via busses and trains where I was physically abused 12 hours a day by Shaolin monks all in the hope of learning 'traditional' Shaolin Kung Fu (at this academy http://www.chinashaolins.com/); * ended up on a 30 hour 'hell ride' on a train from Shanghai to Nanning without a seat, in order to get out of the country before my visa expired (the Chinese were not a country I wanted to mess with re overstaying);* cruised through Vietnam and Cambodia on a combination of busses and trains; and * had a whirlwind 3 days of trains, busses and border crossings at odd hours to get me from Siem Reap (Cambodia) to Singapore (via Thailand and Malaysia). The reason I'm in Singapore now, and the reason I've been rushing so much lately, is because I'm presented with a bit of an issue - I promised my lovely mother that I'd be home for Christmas and I need to keep that promise (my Dad's most recent advice to me was 'if you don't make it home for Christmas, don't bother coming home'). However, I also don't want to give up this 'no flying' challenge, when I'm 25,000+ kms in and so close (comparatively) to home. I suppose my has 2 purposes:1) AMA about my trip - whether it's advice or local knowledge about places I've been through, train/bike/car/bus experiences and advice, visa issues, how to get away without paying bribes to traffic cops etc.; and2) seeing if anyone out there can help me - as you'll see from the first link, I'm on the look out for anyone who has any contacts in the shipping industry and can help me get on a boat back to Australia. Otherwise, I'm just going to be walking the docks for a while, annoying people until they finally give in. ",False,,,,

Visiting Singapore for 5 days on a tight budget.,"My friends and I will be touring Singapore next month, but decided to go on a **tight budget scheme** (still doubtful if we would survive this trip) since we got this flight on a super low deal... and everything was so sudden.  We will be staying in a hostel in Bugis and maybe spend a day in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, then go back again. Basically my three main goals for this trip are food, a little bit of shopping and a lot of photo taking. Little bit of sight-seeing, too, though it is known that most attractions in Singapore are really expensive. So, here are some of the places that we plan on going:-Kampong Glam-Holland Village (?)-Chinatown-Little India-Orchard Road-Clark Quay-Zouk (is this still a good place for clubbing?)-Maxwell Road Hawker Centre -Bugis Night Market/Bugis Junction-Mustafa Centre-Marina Bay Sands + Merlion Park-Gardens by the bay (?)-Sentosa: (?)I’m quite unfamiliar with the place but I’ve done some research but I still have so many questions. I figured that the best people to ask for help are people who have been there or Singaporeans themselves. I’m clueless as to what’s going to happen to us. 1.Any more shopping centres/bazaars we should go? Probably somewhere we could do some bargaining, and some souvenir shopping as well.2.I’ve read somewhere about the **Clark Quay flea market.** Does it still exist?3.What’s a good place to go in Johor Bahru? What to do? Should we take a ferry or the bus? Of course, we’re aiming for the cheaper one :D 4.Are there any relatively cheap/free places I could at least enjoy? I also don’t mind any recommendations of places that you think is underrated and should be visited. I’m pretty sure I’ve forgot to list some good places to visit, but it would be a blast to see them as well.5.Someone told me that a tour guide/trip package is a must.

What things about Singapore irk you?,"Yes, I do complain about the usual stuff like weather and the *government* but there is this one thing which irritates the heck out of me. The level of graciousness is appalling. From driving on the roads to giving up seats to those more in need. I've seen able-bodied men snatch seats from women, on trains and buses. I've seen people pretending to sleep or not acknowledging their surroundings when there are people more in need of the seats. Everyone knows how drivers are on the roads here so I won't elaborate, but there's one thing I want to highlight, that is - pedestrians having to watch out for cars and sometimes worry that the car won't slow down at zebra crossings! When entering places, some people don't even bother to hold the door open for the next person when they are right behind them. Edit: when on a two way walkway keep to one side and not make people walking in the opposite direction have to squeeze their way through, even when walking up overhead bridges. When on a public bus, not seating on the outer seat when no one is on the inner one. Not standing in front of the bus stop when 10 plus people behind you are trying to look out for their buses.This problem might have stemmed from school (primary and secondary), where we aim to be the best and not care about who falls along the wayside. It might be what was taught to us since young, by our parents and teachers and actions of older generations. It might have been many other reasons.

Havelock?Me: HOW-GUNG..HOW-GUNG HOW-GUNG.Uncle: Ok, you show me the way ahh?This happens in nearly every taxi I enter, regardless of where I am going. I have to keep repeating myself, despite speaking English slowly and clearly.Nearly every time I go to a Kopitiam, like my meal tonight which ultimately led to this post.Me: Can I have one bubur pulut hitam?Lady: AHH?Me: Can I have one Bu-bur-pu-lut-hi-tam?Lady: GHSGJHSGHJSG AH?Me: Sure*As she is pouring it into the bowl*Me: Can I have extra coconut cream?Lady: AHH? Me: Extra coconut cream pleaseLady: Extra Ahh? *Dips ladle in to get extra juice from the pot of bubur pulut hitam and makes the dish super watered down.*She then pours one little spoon of cream on top, when I have basically begged to have extra at this point. She then just hands it to me and says ""Ok Ahh?"" No, it's not fucking OK. However, talking to this woman at this point would just further frustrate me and probably land me on Stomp.Another example at the Kopitiam...a different stall. I'm ordering food and I ask the man if the curry is Chicken. ""Yes yes chicken yes."" I ask, is it boneless? ""AHHH?"" Is it boneless or does it have bones in it, the chicken? He just scoops up some and holds it there for me to look at, which does nothing to answer my question.Ok, now look. I understand it may seem trivial, but it's really starting to frustrate me to the point that it's pissing me the fuck off. I'm not stupid, I don't speak like I have shit in my mouth, aside from ""American,"" I have no crazy accent. I'm speaking clearly, and loud enough for normal people to hear. What the fuck is so different that I keep running into these same problems with people at hawker stands and in taxis? I'm paying to get food, or to use a service, and I would like to receive that food or service a specific way, that is well within reason. However, these people make it so difficult, that the entire experience just leaves me pissed off and I regret going in the first place.Excuse me if this makes me sound like an asshole, but Singapore's official language is English, correct?

How is wireless so awful in Singapore?,"Singapore is tiny and supposed to be modern. Yet, the country seems to be struggling with basic wireless coverage. I have two wireless plans; one from Singtel and one from Starhub. Both, get atrocious speeds in Farrer Park and even in the CBD.I called both companies who make me do a series of tests and eventually just said that the network is saturated (Singtel) and blamed it on people torrenting (Starhub). I told them ""so, how is that my problem? fix it or cancel my service"". Both companies told me they would have a ""tech"" investigate and get back to me. I never got a call back, and when I call them back 1 month later they have no idea who I am. Basically, back to square one.I have a 7Mbps plan (Starhub) and a 21Mbps plan (Singtel). If speeds are 1% of what I was promised, shouldn't I be paying 1% of what I promised?With Starhub, I can not cancel. Singtel allows me to cancel, but with an early termination fee.Does anyone have similar experiences? This is basically fraud. Why am I paying for a service I can't use?Some notes:1. Farrer Park is where I live. I work late and typically access the internet at midnight or later. Hardly what I would call peak time. My speeds vary from 1k - 120k down and frequently just drop. I connect to 3G, HSPDA, HSPDA+, and G. It really varies, but the speed is awful in all cases.2. I work in Raffles and while I don't have my connection drop, speeds are just as bad and fluctuate wildly. I am typically using 3G.3. I have used three devices so I know it's not a hardware issue.

What languages do you use and when?,"So Singaporeans, as an Australian who was raised in, and still lives, a monolingual environment, and who has never been to Singapore (although I'm looking forward to visiting next year), I'm curious to know - what languages do you use, and when?My understanding is that pretty much everyone (except for maybe some older people or recent migrants/foreign workers) can speak English fluently, although some people may use Singlish far more than ""Standard"" English.  I also know that students learn their ""mother tongue"" in school, and so most people can speak at least some Mandarin/Malay/Tamil (depending on their race).Do you speak English or other languages most of the time with your friends? At work? Out and about?Does this change depending on whether the person is younger/older/the same age as you? (e.g. if you're talking to an elderly person who might not have had much schooling in English)If you're talking to another person of the same race that you do not know (e.g. a stranger on the bus), do you use English or your mother tongue? How do you know which to use?How about in the home environment? Do your parents speak the same language with you that they spoke with their parents? If not, was it a conscious decision to change or did it just happen?Do you ever get into situations with people where you don't have any languages in common?Bonus question for Chinese Singaporeans - can you only speak Mandarin, or do you know/use other dialects?**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for your responses!

Obviously I would like to eat out (cheaply) sometimes to experience the foor of Singapore, but someone told me to expect to spend around $150 u.s. a week on food and that sounds entirely too high to me.2) How much a week should I expect to spend on transportation costs?  I would be working downtown, but I'm not entirely sure where I'm living yet. I know I'm living in a ""student residence"" or some type of student dormitory near downtown, but I'm not sure exactly where that is....I know that's probably not a sufficient amount of information to give me an estimate but a rough transportation cost for nearby areas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot!",False,,,,

"Reddiporeans, I need your advice. I'm very low on battery","Last Monday, I flew back to Singapore after spending the holidays with my loved ones. As the plane descended, my eardrum started to get irritated so I did the usual tricks we do (suck a candy, drink a bit of water, closed my nose and mount and tried to exhale slowly) but none of those worked. For 25 mins while the pain was building up I tried to do anything and everything I could but nothing was working so I just covered my ears and endure the most painful landing in my life so far.In Changi, after getting off the plane I was still in extreme pain but I can still put on a decent face.  I hoped that the pain would immediately go away after the cabin door was opened but it wasn't the case. My left ear can't hear anything and my right side was equially painful but its working. Took a cab, went home and slept, hoping that it will go away after a good amount of rest.When I woke up, it was a little bit better than the night before, and the usual tricks to equalize ear pressure still doesn't work. Thinking I couldn't do anything about it and it should slowly go away over time, I went to work. Around dawn, I started to have fever. That was Monday night. Tuesday night when I woke up I had high fever and chills, and it was extremely painful to swallow even a small pocket of air. I thought it was tonsilitis but the pain was on a different level. I cringe whenever I tried to drink water, there's pain in the throat and pain in the left ear as well.Good thing we have a clinic downstairs (healthway), so I went down and got myself checked up. That was January 1. After a close to 2 minutes interview (not an exaggeration) he took a quick look at my throat and told me that its indeed tonsilitis, and I was given augmentin as antibiotic, and danzen as anti-inflamattory. Lozenges and panadol as well as painkillers.Cool, so I went upstairs, took the first doses of meds, and decided to take a sick day from work. Panadol got rid of the fever, lozenges doesn't seem to work, the extreme pain when swallowing was still there. It's just the first day, so I went to endurance mode tried to wait for the pleasant effects of the antibiotics.The whole of Tuesday truly sucked. I try not to swallow as much as I can. I have to bear the pain whenever taking the meds. Loss of appetite due to bitter taste and fear of the pain from swallowing, high fever and chills when the paracetamol wears off (and it wears of pretty fast, like 3 hours. I can only take the maximum dosage on a 6 hourly intervals otherwise I'll kill my kidney). I didn't have a good sleep for 2 nights now, because I have to spit out saliva once in a while otherwise I'll cringe and take the whole head in a world of pain with it.I really don't know what danzen/serratiopeptidase does for me (it says anti-inflammatory but my throat certainly feels its getting worse) so I googled it up. Well, to my surprise and dismay, the second article from google results say that Takeda (the makers of Danzen) have already withrawn Danzen since Feb 11 because of multiple studies showing no evidence of the pill as a medicinal product.furthermore and I quote:""...Considering the long history of use in the Singapore with minimal safety concerns, the phase-out process will follow a gradual approach to ensure that immediate impact on patients and industry stakeholders is minimized.

""source: http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/news_events/hsa_updates/2011/hsa_updates_on_the0.html?CFC_cK=1322548580121wikipedia summed it up pretty good: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerratiopeptidaseSo I'm done with Danzen and enough of it.Wednesday noon, I'm sitting down directly against the sunlight in my room, jacket and PJ's, feeling very cold and having some chills. I attempted to eat regular hawker food several times but I just couldn't, due to pain and bitter taste. I stay alone here in Singapore, so I have nobody to cook chicken soup and all that 'good stuff when youre sick' for me.Moving around was painful as well, due to high fever and chills. Luckily there's a grocery store downstairs, so I went there with a full jacket and jogging pants at 2PM at the height of the sun. Took bananas, mandarin, apple and pears, papaya and watermelon. Wednesday evening I'm punching my wooden door with my bare fist because of the pain in swallowing, and fever chills. Pain is extreme and is getting worse. I want to get myself checked in into a hospital. Nearest to me is mt Alvernia so I waited for the panadol hour, wait for 30 mins for the effects, and went there.In the hospital, wating time was around 2 hours but the paracetamol effect atleast for me, based on my observation, was around 3 hours so no problem, I'm well within the range. I can put on a straight face, I tried not to swallow but it was extremely difficult because now I don't have a spit can with me, so when I swallow saliva that's the only time I cringe. temp was 38.5 and no chills. Finally it was my turn so I described what happened to the doc, but not as detailed as I want it to be, because she keeps on interrupting me I think because she only wants straight answers to her own questions. I figured out that this is how she does her stuff, so I gave in, thinking she must be a badass doc because the badass sysadmins from my company are the same way: they will shut you up on the phone, they will ask you 3 questions, you answer them short and sweet, and truthfully as well, because if you lie for some reason they'll know it in 3 seconds and ask you a supporting question where the answer contradicts the first one that you gave.What I wanted to happen was for the doc to realize that I had been in extreme pain for 2 days now, unable to eat and drink as much as my body needs to recover, and to take me in and do some test or whatever is needed to recover from this bad case of tonsillitis. She took a look at my throat, surprise! its not tonsilitis, but you have ulcers in your tonsil. Ok, I've rarely had ulcers in my mouth before, but in the tonsil? first time. maybe that's why the pain when swallowing is on a different level. In the end she asked me to continue augmentin, gave another antibiotic to take with it (zithromax), gave ibuprofen, and DANZEN! But by that time I can feel that the paracetamol effect is wearing off, so I just wanted to go home asap. She gave me a MC for 1 day, me thinking that she thinks zithromax will fix me up in 1 day which is really awesome.Thursday morning. 4th day of pain. no noticeable improvements. I'm physically drained already. Enduring the pain when taking meds, hydrating myself, feeding myself, takes a lot of energy. Now its friday morning. I'll be taking the second dose of zithromax at 9am. if there's no noticeable relief by afternoon, I'll drag myself back to mt alvernia. I'll ask straight out if they can admit me in the hospital because I think my batteries are about to run out, if they are going to try another antibiotic for me. If they think I'm just being a wussy and refuse to admit me, I'll ask if its possible to give me a permit to fly, and I'll seek medical attention elsewhere. Is this a good plan?TL;DR: I've been sick and out from the office for 4 days now, which is not a good thing in Singapore's workaholic culture. I can't remember the last time getting sick like this, usually I can bear fever, flu and tonsilitis, working from home on really bad days. But this one I'm having right now is really bad and different from the ones I've had before, and I don't know how to translate it into words that will convince the doctor to take me in into the hospital or even begin to listen. Plan is to acquire a permit to fly certificate if they don't want to take me in. ",False,,,,

Donated Blood Today,"Hi,[Gallery of Pics](http://imgur.com/a/bXU2M)Donated Blood today,wanted to share how it went.I donated at   Bloodbank @ Health Sciences Authority (HSA)  Its close to Outram Park MRT Station, walking distance.**[List of places to donate](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/wheretodonate.html?direct=1)**You can choose to donate * whole blood (regular donation) **OR*** platelets and plasma ([apheresis](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate/apheresis.html))Apheresis is recommended for non-first timers in my opinion.Apheresis requires large veins that will not collapse for the hour long procedure.I tried once but it collapsed halfway. They told me to try again in 2 years.**Highly recommended to make an appointment before going down**-Its pretty fast, can just make a phone call or use your SingPass-You get placed in a priority line, which speed things up a bit depending on the crowd that day.Once inside, this is the rough flow of things.1. Fill up Questionnaire, hand it in.2. Wait to be called for the doctor to take your blood pressure, temperature etc.3. Next station, they prick a finger to test your haemoglobin levels to see whether you meet the minimum. 4. Enter the area with the chairs, and the staff will get you prepared for the procedure, pretty friendly, though it seems that they use similar lines to make donors feel at ease, better than nothing though.5. Vein check, inject anaesthesia, etc, the actual process itself.6. Wait for blood to be drawn out, 450 mls. My bag took 3:30 for it to be filled.The actual process itself is very much shorter than the form-filling and waiting. Pretty fast, total time is close to half hour.During the process itself the staff will hand you a food voucher, and some iron tablets to replenish your iron supply.**If you visit in between 11.30 and 1.30pm**It is considered lunchtime and a full meal will be redeemed using the voucher.[**Menu for that day**](http://imgur.com/PQBHX)Other times would just be a snack.I also received a pretty thick notebook. Hardcover and bound pretty nicely. Came in a plastic cover shaped like a blood bag and a sticker/decal that mimicked a blood bag label.On top of that there was also an extra gift because of donating during my birthday month. It was an handheld electric fan with a pretty cute and cool function, where it flashed ""Happy Birthday"".

Comment on urban architecture of Singapore,"I thought this comment, in response to [this page](http://www.oobject.com/15-housing-projects-from-hell/housing-amp-development-board-project-singapore/5214/), was interesting: &gt;As an architecture student, I am well aware of the discourse on the modernist aesthetic of public housing and urban design. However, I have to point out that the Singaporean model of public housing is a different creature altogether. It simply doesn’t suffer the social stigma that comes with public housing in other countries- this is of course, the result of a complex mix of social engineering, a paternalistic government and cultural norms that cannot be replicated elsewhere (and thus cannot be claimed as a model for emulation). But to diss it as from hell (apart from the financial cost of owning one due to territorial constraints) is sadly ignorant of the reality.&gt;If anything, in this seemingly antiseptic mix, exists a plethora of unique experiences. Housing the majority of the population, it is arguably the cradle where modern Singaporean culture evolves. There is an intricate underbelly of rich diversity that has, in ways, parasitically grown and embedded itself in these seemingly dead concrete jungles.&gt;As with all places, it is the love that people have for their homes that ensures they do not descend into slums (not that slums themselves do not have architectural merit and value in the carving of niche spaces). It might seem contrived on the onset, but from these concrete nooks, diverse identities do emerge- perhaps an evidence in the triumph of the human spirit against the tabula-rasa origins of these builds. They are often a unique case study in the value of public spaces against elitist gated communities that do more harm for urban design and community building than these surely. These blocks are consistently maintained in pristine condition throughout their 99 year estate life and remain safe lively places where I would have no qualms letting my children run free.&gt;I find it sad that all these merits are often overlooked in the name of spectacle or when merely judged from imagery. I reiterate that it most certainly doesn’t work elsewhere and that perhaps the very fact that it does work here brings up problematic Orwellian questions on what sort of rights people relinquish to their governments, but to write-off the social fabric that has grown from it as hell is dismissive and sadly short-sighted. Sometimes things have more than one solution.",False,,,,
Is there any way to tell if someone who is appealing for donations in public is actually acting on behalf of a legitimate organization?,"I've seen quite a number of people appealing for donations for various charities around Singapore, especially at the MRT stations.

And if not, how can these people be reported?Also, I've noticed that they constantly target students, and try to avoid adults. This raises giant red flag here.Edit: If I think someone is collecting donations without a license (or scamming people), how can I raise the matter to the police?

Not paying last 2 months rent (security deposit).,"My 2 year lease is coming to an end in 3 months and the landlord is in China (as far as I know, they have not even been to Singapore). All my dealings have been with the property agent.While I have had zero issues and never needed to contact my landlord I have received several bills from building management that the landlord has not paid for over 6 months. They started chasing me to help find the landlord's contact details and I just pointed them towards the agent. To this day, I still think he has not paid. The bills were for some basic maintenance costs I think.Now, I have been paying my rent on-time, and without issue for the past 20 months, however as my lease is coming to an end I am hesitant to pay the final 2 months because I'm worried that I will not get my security deposit. The person is in China and considering they didn't pay some small building fees, I don't want to end up chasing them for several months for my money. And in the worst case, if they just decide not to pay me, I don't know what I can do.So I'm considering just not paying the last 2 months. The apartment was brand new when I moved in and still in perfect condition. I'm a very neat person.What do you guys think? I've asked a few friends who agree that I shouldn't pay and said that the worst case scenario is the landlord sues me for the last 2 months rent (which they already have anyway).Thanks!*Edit:* I should note that my previous experience with my first landlord was awful. They didn't pay me my security deposit and I had to chase them for 4-5 months. Finally they paid me and said ""oh sorry, I was travelling"". I know that doesn't have much to do with this case, but I don't want to go through that (or worse) again.**tl;dr** I have a feeling my landlord won't pay me back my security deposit.

"Men of Singapore, can you give an in-depth walk-through of National Service?","Hey guys,I am from the US (Oklahoma), and I was having a chat with a friend yesterday about gun laws. In Oklahoma, almost anyone over the age of 21 can purchase a gun and ammunition without any sort of safety training or certification. There are exceptions (ex-convicts, etc...)(However, you do need a license in order to carry guns in public.) This led me to believe there were more than a couple gun owners that do not know the importance of gun safety. I told my friend about Singapore's National Service requirement and concluded that Singapore's general population likely has a better understanding of gun safety than the average Oklahoman (or American). This led me to [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Singapore) about NS. While it does go in depth with regard to the administrative side of NS, some information about Basic Military Training, and the different branches that embody NS, I am looking more specifically for what exactly is taught to the average young man over the 2 years of NS. I also visited a national website, but really, [this](http://i.imgur.com/uvZP1.jpg) didn't do it for me.So I turn to you, r/Singapore, what basic training did you receive? Did everybody get properly trained in gun safety? What were the living conditions like? Were there any life lessons learned over the 2 years? If you were obese, how do you think your experience differed from the other servicemen? Would you do it again? Did you love it or hate it? I'm just looking for some first-hand accounts of NS for a somewhat ignorant American.Thanks!",False,,,,

Anyone here ever work at Pizza Hut? ,"I've been looking for a part-time job around the malls here and was surprised to come up with almost too many options. I went all around but Pizza Hut basically hired me on the spot. The pay is $5.50 an hour and I'm not sure if I should take it, because I have so many other options, including an ice cream shop (that pays $6.50/hr) that basically also hired me. However, the people working at Pizza Hut seem very nice so even though the pay is obviously less and it's probably more work, I'm not sure what to do. Anyone care to shed light on this? Is working at Pizza Hut good?I also have been to other places like clothing shops, that actually were hiring ($7/hr) that would call me when they wanted to interview me. However, both Pizza Hut and the ice cream shop thought they had already ""hired"" me basically and are expecting me at work next week.... (I'm still free to call them and change my mind, though, they told me)However I don't know. I can't just delay going to work there because I'm waiting to see if the clothes shop will hire me, right? Also, Manhattan Fish Market offers to pay about $7 an hour. So, should I go with that, instead? It's also easier to get there, transportation-wise. There were tons more options that involve calling a number to speak to HR or something but now, since I already have so many choices, I don't think I will do that.So what do you all think? Are these good part-time jobs? Are there better ones out there? ",False,,,,
Desperate soul seeking advice and/or help from a kind hearted Reddiporean. ,"First of all let me thank you for clicking this. I'm not sure where to start perhaps a bit of background. (this may be very long so look for a TL:DR at the end too) More than ten years ago I met a girl online and started talking with her. Found out she was in Singapore. I, being a typical American had no idea where that was. Nor did I know anything about the country. But, after around two years of talking with her, and both of us falling madly into young love with each other I decided to save up some money and make the trip to see her. My first time so far from my shire and first time traveling alone. I had an amazing, albeit too short week long visit with her. I nearly married her. Wanted to stay. But being so young, did neither. Then, after getting back to the States, I hit many hard times. I don't think I need to go into the details really but I nearly became homeless and couldnt talk to my love anymore. I sent handwritten letters regularly for months. But, it was a hard time for our relationship. I eventually got things back on track and kept my home, returned most utilities, and started talking with her again. Found out things on her end had changed more than I knew. She had found someone else in my absence. But I foolishly held on to what we had. (a HUGE mistake I would later find out) I still loved her and still wanted to move to Singapore to be with and start a life with her. So, I made plans to save up and do so. But, life has a way of getting in the way of plans. Family issues, taking care of Grandmother with dementia, terrible economy, and lets skip ahead a lot to this last october... I've been staying with and caring for my 86 year old Grandmother for a few years now. Being the only member of my family that isnt married with kids and a stable job I the only one that can take the time off to do so. I love my Grandmother and am glad to help her in any way. Even if her dementia is pretty bad and she is quite a handful. I don't mind. She happens to live in a not so crime free area of Atlanta and I awake to find my car stolen from her driveway one day. It was an old car and I sure it was stripped before I even woke to find it gone. After no sign of it in a month my insurance give me a very small check that actually goes to pay for a tree that fell on the house during a storm. So, I now have no vehicle. Borrowing my grandmothers car to make trips to grocery and doctor appointments. So, its mid November now and My Grandmother has gotten much worse as of the last few days. I can see what is happening. She passes in her sleep in her own bed. The best for her I believe. Funeral is handled by my Mother and her Brothers. And I decide that I need to get away. Start over. Make that trip to Singapore. I actually booked a flight before my Grandmother really started going downhill. I know the timing is pretty bad but I have made up my mind to commit to this. I make the flight, meet my long time friend and ex girlfriend. (going to leave out some details here for her and my protection) I stay in a hostel and spend lots of time with her. Things go fairly well but we both feel awkward at times. I'm trying to rekindle a love that she doesnt have for me. She has told me that it's not going to happen but I'm an idiot and try anyway. She is nothing but helpful and kind to me. I spend Christmas with her amazing family. She tries to find me work, her Dad tries to find me a cheap place to stay and work. I should treat her like a queen. I end up several times doing stupid things that disrespect her and now as I write this she won't meet me in person. She and I still talk on the phone and sms but that's it. Ten years of friendship destroyed in less than two months. Now I sit on a bed in a hostel that I have booked till the 5th of February. I have about S$500 to my name. Not enough to get a ticket back to the States. No best friend. No job. No idea what to do. You may ask why I'm putting all this on Reddit. Or why in /r/Singapore. Well, I know I've seen Reddit do some amazingly good and kind things for others. I guess I'm just hoping someone out there can help me. I'm open to any comments, suggestions, offers, anything. I really would love to find work and a place to stay here in Singapore. I do love this country and it's people. I really do. I guess I will end this with a simple plea for anyone that can help. I'm more than willing to work hard from the bottom. I have a proven record of management and fair computer skills. I'm a bit of an artist and a very quick learner. Please, if you can help, say so here or PM me. I thank you for your time and wish you the best in this new year. TL:DR American in Singapore with little money and soon no place to stay. Has tried to find work here for two months with no luck. Also managed to ruin a ten year friendship in that time. Needs a kind Reddiporean to give him a chance. A job, a place, or advice.

This is a throwaway account, I just need some counselling and advice from other S'poreans.A little backstory first: I'm an 18-year-old student in Singapore. I live with 3 siblings (youngest:10, oldest:19), my parents, and my paternal grandparents.Two days ago at school, on Wednesday, I received a threatening SMS from a number I didn't recognize. When I reached home, my house phone had been getting phone calls from unknown numbers and people.I later found out that my dad had apparently borrowed money from the loan sharks, and he had failed to pay off this week's payment. I waited for him to come home, but... he didn't. The little cad ran away, saying he had ""no face to face you guys anymore"". He left a family of 4 children, his wife, and his **own goddamn parents** to deal with the fallout. He came back in the middle of the night that day, but he left really early in the morning, ignoring me. I left for school, as per normal. When I reached home, my grandma told me that my younger sister (age 10) had sneaked out of the house after my dad. They apparently ran to Johor.Today, I had more great news waiting for me when I reached home. Around 10AM, when there was nobody at home, my mum had decided to run after my dad. Leaving us alone. I've been told over 10 times that if we don't come up with $350 by tonight, 8PM, they'll come over and break our legs. I'm a student, for fuck's sake. I really don't know what to do. We've tried everything; none of our family members want to help.We haven't called the police yet, because of two things:1: We don't know what will happen if we do that. 2: The police probably won't believe us. A few threatening SMSes, a few missed calls? ""Where're your parents?"" I wouldn't blame them if they thought this was a joke.Please, if anyone can help, please comment. We just need some advice on what to do now.------------------------------------------------------------------------------**EDIT**: Thank you, everyone who has replied.

My experience clubbing in CQ last weekend. ,"Last week me and some friends went to Clarke quay. We're all American guys. 3 white, 1 black dude. When we got inside there was a table of 3 girls and we started talking to them. Before long a few Singaporean guys came over and told us they knew the girls and we should leave because ""we are bothering the girls"". Anyway we ignored them.  We were having a great time and even the girl I was talking to said she doesn't know who they are. Eventually they walked away and we figured out that 1 of the girls knew one of the guys. But again, we weren't forcing the girls to stay and they even offered to buy me a drink since it was my birthday. 10 minutes later the douchebags came back with more guys and literally pulled the girl they knew away. They brought over a security guard who asked us to leave even though we did nothing wrong. I must admit that the situation would have got heated if the security guard wasn't there but only because of how these guys were acting. Anyway we left and called it a night.

Singaporeans Plan Protest as Parliament Debates Population Boost. (Whoa is this really happening?),nan,False,,,,
PAP MP Inderjit Singh shares his objections to the recently released White Paper on Population,"Speech by Mr Inderjit Singh,MP for Ang Mo Kio GRCOn the White Paper on PopulationMadam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the White Paper on Population.While the report has some compelling arguments for the 6.9m population figure projected, we all know it is based mainly on economic considerations. Had we focused on things like building a cohesive nation with a strong national identity, the outcome would likely be very different.I feel the time has come for us to find a better balance between economic growth and social cohesion and yes there will have to be tradeoffs of economic growth but I would rather trade some of these for a cohesive, united nation where people feel taken care of at home and are confident of their future. I am not saying we go for low or no growth. Instead I am willing to adjust my growth expectations for a more comfortable life for all Singaporeans. I am confident we will still be able to pursue respectable economic growth when companies and Singaporeans are faced with a situation of tightened labour availability by focusing on improving ourselves through productivity and higher value capabilities. Finland and other small nations have done, we can do it too.Our past decade of rapid population growth has already created too many problems which need to be solved first before we take the next step. I call on the government to take a breather for five years, solve all the problems created by the past policies of rapid economic and population growth. We can safely say that we have failed to achieve the goal set by the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, of a Swiss standard of living for most Singaporeans, except for the higher income Singaporeans including foreigners who just recently decided to make Singapore their home. So I call for a breather in this quest of growing the population and focus on improving the lives of Singaporeans and achieve that promised Swiss Standard of living for most Singaporeans first before we plan our next growth trajectory.Taking Care of the Singaporean CoreI have a big issue with the number of PRs and new citizens we are planning to add to our population. I don't see the necessity to be as aggressive when the key consideration of the population growth is the economy. We have already added too many new citizens and PRs and need time for integration and social cohesion to happen. Looking at history, our population grew from around 2.4m in 1980 to 3m in 1990 and then to 4m in 2000, reaching 5.3m last year. Just looking at the resident population alone, we grew the numbers from 2.3m in 1980 to 2.7m in 1990, 3.3m in the year 2000 and then to 3.8m last year. So in the last decade we added more than 1m to the resident population, and the in last 25 years, which is close to 1 generation of Singaporeans, we have added another close to 50% more to our resident population. I believe this must be the fastest rate of population growth in the world and I feel this is just too much for us to comfortably go back and build a national identity and social cohesion which was progressing very well till the 1990s. Adding another 500,000 to 800,000 more PRs and citizens as proposed by the white paper will be disastrous and add to our already difficult infrastructure and social problems.If it is economic growth we want then let's just adopt the Dubai model of a transient workforce which will give us a lot more flexibility to manage numbers in the longer term. On PRs, today we already have too many of them and they are enjoying full citizen privileges without the citizens' responsibilities. For example;- Far too many PR boys who skip NS when they turn 18. After enjoying the privileges they have a choice of not doing NS and then leave the country. I believe only around 30% of all PR boys do NS today. Well, our Singapore sons don't have a choice but to do NS, it is an office not to do it.- PR children study at their International system schools sticking to their home cultures.- PRs can buy HDB flats from the open market driving prices of HDB flats too high.So I urge the government to reduce the number of projected new PRs and citizens just to the population replacement levels and be more selective and differentiate their privileges from citizens. I have a few suggestions for the government to consider;• The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round, reduce fees for Singaporeans not just increase for PRs.• PR children must be made do national service - it should no longer be a choice and we should make it an offence if they don’t do it. We should not grant PRs to families who don’t commit their sons to National Service.• HDB - if a PR buys a HDB flat from the open market, charge a levy of say $50k and allow them to sell only to Singaporeans. If the PR takes up citizenship within 5 years, we can refund the levy.• Children of PRs should be made to study in our national schools so that we increase the chance of integrating them at the next generation.• On the employment front, it is time we implement a Singaporean first hiring policy like what is done in some developed countries like Canada. Companies should show proof first that they were not able to fill a position with a Singaporean before they are allowed to hire a foreigner.• Reconsider the dependents policy - I have come across a number of cases where our targeted one child from China brings in 2 parents who then bring 2 parents each as their dependents - Net is that we gain one young one child who we brought in for our future but also inherited 6 older people - making our ageing population issue worse not better.I feel the differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens.This brings me to the point of how many Singaporeans are feeling about the presence of such huge numbers of new citizens, PRs and foreigners amongst our midst. First for housing - there is no doubt that the influx of foreigners in Singapore has driven up our property prices. PRs are buying HDB flats from the open market which drives up prices.Just last week I had a dialogue session with my private estates residents and one of my residents complained that a new citizens recently bought a landed property in this old estate and was building a 3 and a half storey towering house. Well the, new citizen, the owner of the house was also present and when, I spoke with him during the tea session I found out that he was a new citizen formerly from China, just gained his citizenship and bought not 1 but 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru alone. I was surprised and saddened because many Singaporeans cannot afford to do the same, and this new citizen, no matter how he may have made his wealth is able to do so.Many young Singaporeans I talk to, especially those who have recently graduated and have just entered the workforce feel demoralized because many of the things that they grew up aspiring to have are now beyond their reach. Our aggressive growth strategies, which allowed cheaper foreign workers, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans. I remember when I started work in 1985, my salary was $1900 as an entry level engineer. After a few years I could afford a house and a car. Today, 28 years later, an entry level engineer in Singapore earns $2600, just $700 more than what I earned when I started. The mathematics is very simple, the cost of living did not just go up by 1.3% per annum the last 27 years and even more, the cost of owning a HDB flat is did not just go up by 37% since 1985.Finally, I am perturbed by the banquet analogy used by Minister Khaw. We are talking about lives of Singaporeans. Our banquet guests come for one night and leave when the function is over. There is no turning back when we grant PR and citizenships. We must be more exact about the numbers we want to add to the Singapore population and not plan on a basis of 'hoping we hit some number"". Because if overdo things and end up with a population of more than 7m, it may be too late to stop the fast moving train of population growth when we fire up all the engines of growing the population. We missed the mark the last 10 years, and are already paying a high price for that mistake.In my speech in this house in 2008 during the committee of supply debate on the population I urged the government to abandon the ""the instant tree mentality"" in trying to grow the population in response to the declining birth rates. At that time, I did not agree with the rate of growth pursued and we know the consequences and the hardship Singaporeans faced as a result of the rapid growth, Instant trees cannot grow strong roots and can be uprooted in difficult times. I once again urge the government to slow down and plan on reaching their population target over a longer time horizon. I don't think we can live with a 6.9m population in 2030. We may be able to handle it in 2050, no one really knows. Please abandon this 'instant tree"" mentality as we cannot afford to make Singaporeans lives more difficult as a result. I rather we err on the side of caution when it comes to growing our population. We cannot keep paying a high price for planning misjudgements.In Conclusion, I would like to see us take a breather from re-growing our population again. We have too many problems as a result of the last breath taking population growth rate. As a government we need to rebuild the trust and confidence among Singaporeans that our citizens matter most to us and that we are willing take a break from our relentless drive for growth to solve their problems, make their lives more comfortable, give them a better quality of life and show them that any future growth of population will not create similar social and cost of living problems. At this stage many Singaporeans from all walks of life don't have the confidence that we can handle another steep growth of the population, so let's not push it. I would like all of us, including the government to spend the time creating and environment that gives us confidence in our future and one where our young can see a sense of hope of opportunity and if we fail to instil a sense of hope and opportunity for our future generations, we will not be able to root them here and build a strong national identity and a strong nation. This is what building a strong Singapore core should entail. So let's delay all plans for further population growth for now.",False,,,,

Dad hit me last night. What should I do?,"Hi reddiporeans. I need some advice on how to deal with my dad. Last night at around 1.30am I [23f] had an argument with my dad - who is extremely hot-headed and can get violent when things don't go his way. So things got heated last night. He threw a ceramic bowl at me, shattering it and he clubbed me on my head twice with his fist. Then my mother came between us to stop him and he pushed both of us. My mother then pushed me into my room and asked me to lock the door while my father went into the store room to get the vacuum cleaner pipe and threatened to hit me with it. He later went out and only came back home late afternoon today. When my mum heard he was coming home, she asked me to go to my cousin's place to hide. He told my mum he will hit me again if he sees me. I'm home now and he isn't due to work. He only comes back home once or twice a week because of work, so I have a bit of leeway there.It's not the first time he's physical. In the past when I was younger, he's hit/slapped me and my sister a number of times and once smashed my computer then redeemed himself the next day by buying a new one. All of us at home feel like we're walking on eggshells around him. He verbally abuses us, especially my mother and she's been very okay with it. I'm very tempted to have him charged by the police. He's not only physical with me but also with his employees. But everyone in the family, including my mum and sister, is telling me to apologise to him and let the matter rest because he is my dad. If I do want to make a report, what will happen?I don't know how to proceed now - how to face him and continue living with him and if I should report him to the police. This is a throwaway account.**EDIT, 19feb 10pm**: I didn't make any police report. I initially wanted to make one just for the record in case he hits me again. My mum and aunt convinced me not to, telling me to give him another chance and just live out my last few years under his roof with him quietly and resiliently. I haven't seen him since the night he hit me. But he's called home and asked my mum how I'm doing, showing remorse. I guess I feel better but still emotionally hurt that he hit me. At least now I know (thanks to [nvendr](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/18p1pt/dad_hit_me_last_night_what_should_i_do/c8gpjn1)) what to do if he gets physical again.

The course materials have just been updated, with a stronger emphasis on lean analytics and on making the materials work for corporate participants. As Isaac Souweine, Pollenizer's GM, has discussed here [http://pollenizer.com/2013-the-year-of-the-lean-enterprise], lean startup is an especially hot topic in the enterprise space, and we're keen to leverage this interest.

Part-time Job Opening for Anyone Residing in Singapore. (Work from home),"Position: Virtual personal assistant to a real estate agent. Work from home, report to the employer only once every month. No qualifications needed except for a good command of English and self-discipline. Duties include:-Writing advertisements/listings for property-Refreshing and reposting the ads several times a day-Match properties to your employer's current clients by browsing PropertyGuru-Arrange for property viewings with other agents Note: You'll need to be able to call other agents and converse concisely and professionally.I'll provide the script to that and you just have to practice the pronunciations, easy peasy. Salary:Starts from a basic of $250SGD per month, excluding bonuses of $50SGD per closed deal and, sometimes, on the whim of your generous employer if you have been hardworking PLUS dinner on him once or twice every month. We usually have Japanese food but you can let him know what kind of food you prefer.   Reasons for leaving: I might be moving out of SG soon (Will be confirmed again in a week's time) and I would like to find someone who can take over and learn the ropes before I quit. Since my employer has been super duper nice to me for the past 6 months I have worked for him, I would like to ensure a smooth transition and make things easier for him without any fuss from his end. Personal opinions of the job, not paid to say this: It's really VERY easy money once you learnt the gist of writing the advertisements. We use the same format and formula for every listing. I will be guiding you step-by-step personally so there is no need to worry about being confused at all. This part-time job pays you roughly $10 a day (if there is at least $50 bonus every month, which makes the monthly salary $300) and it takes less than an hour for you to do everything that is asked of you everyday. If you have the spare time (I believe anyone does) and are in need of some quick &amp; easy cash/extra pocket money, just take this up. This kind of job is really a steal! Albeit a little repetitive and boring. To justify, most jobs are anyway. I know this sounds too good to be true but you can take my word for it. All you have to do is just be diligent and do the job well. If you know of anyone who is in need of some money, please direct them to me",False,,,,

"What do you think of a healthy, monthly food home delivery service subscription in Singapore?","I've always stuck around to the idea that If you want to start a business, start one that solves a problem. Ive noticed through reading threads and conversations with locals that besides the regular take away, eating out or expensive food delivery service (SGD$ 25 &lt;), there isn't anything else that a working professional, young couple or families can do for quality food that do not involve personally cooking. The idea derives from a pretty straight forward issue, working professionals spend an average of 8 hours a day at work only to come home to having to cook a meal. (For those who do not have the luxury of a cook or maid.)  Not many people I know enjoy eating out everyday nor do they like the idea of ordering food delivery every other day. To solve this, I wanted to introduced a monthly food home delivery service subscription that will ease the lives of these professionals.How it works: Monthly subscription of SGD $200 (US $160) . Log on to the website, for the time being, lets call it www.1clickmeals.com - once you have subscribed you can order either lunch or dinner to be delivered to your house or office. Just with a click of a mouse. Choose from 15 - 20 different dishes. Perhaps, only main course meals. For lunch, orders need to be set in before 10am and dinner orders before 2.30pm. Subscribers can do this everyday for the entire month. If you don't plan to eat at home that day, you don't have to do anything, just dont order a meal for that day. Subscribers also, upon subscribing get a reusable/ washable food box with their names. Food will be delivered in this box.Math wise, if you order one meal everyday for 30 days, your meals works out to 7 dollars per meal, including delivery. In terms of operations: start off with two cooks, preferably fresh out of cooking/culinary school. Deliveries all done by motorcycle. Still toying around with the idea of a pick up location for meals to reduce delivery costs. I have spoken to people about this (newly married couples) and have received positive remarks, adding that if such a subscription existed, they would sign up, without a doubt. Thoughts?",False,,,,

Those of us who have the capabilities and access (and perhaps even just the will) are ourselves a small part of population: how do we ensure that we aren't blinded by self-righteous indignation, and ensure that the ""vocal minority"" doesn't indeed drown out the ""silent majority""?",False,,,,

What is a good place for a proper massage? where do I go for unique gifts? What are privacy rooms???,"Well Reddit, I have finally arrived in Singapore. It is so humid and hot here! I posted not long ago trying to get some mofo to let me stay in a spare room because I didn't want to get stuck in a boring hotel room by myself (also wanted to save money). Weeelll, guess what? I am stuck in a hotel room by myself near Chinatown. It's not too bad actually - I can do naked gym and leave the LCD tv on whole night ANND nobody looks at me funny. Anyway I was strolling through Chinatown (BY MYSELF) and I got suckered into a small shop by a smiling Chinese girl with a mainland China accent saying that she could 'magic all pain away' 'good massage' 'use computer newest machine' '$29 only!' so I wandered into the den of switchandbait then it became '$49' for extra aromatherapy, $69 if add facial; then she stared at me for a few minutes, declared that I had ugly eyebags and said she'd make a super discount - $100 for newest technology clean up black-black. Bemused, I tried to make her explain the whole process and after 15 minutes of haggling I gave her $100 because I was (a) impressed with her doggedness and thick-face (b) curious. ps: i still have dark under eye circles and ironically i actually know how to treat these properly.Then I tried wandering around Chinatown street (?) and all the knick knacks were the same tacky tourist gag type gifts. Tempted to get a name stamp in chinese, but he quoted $85. Wandered around some more and I noticed signs everywhere saying PRIVACY ROOMS AVAILABLE. Is that what I think it means? What if i Hire a privacy room to meditate or something. TLDR: No tour guide, bumbling through Chinatown Singapore. ",False,,,,

"After I moved out of my rented apartment, my landlady is trying to hold back my deposit....what are my options?","So I'll just give some background. My lease with my current apartment got over in April. I was interested in renewing as was my landlady and we agreed upon a price but I didn't sign anything. Then one weekend she calls and says she's getting calls from agents offering more rent so she managed to arm twist me into increasing by 50 bucks a month. Then a week later it happened again and I said nothing doing, I told her very nicely that I'm not interested in renewing and I found another place within a day. Now she starts hunting for a tenant but she still hasn't found one and she's gonna be losing about 6k+ in agent fees and because of a months lost rent. But she's still being very nice to me till the minute I leave. There was a lot of my stuff in the house (worth around 1.2K) that I want to sell off so on the day I'm moving out, she says instead of selling it she'll ask the new tenant if he's interested in buying it off and she'll transfer the deposit in the evening. Being the trusting naive fool that I am, I agree. Then in the evening I get a call saying that the new tenant is not interested in our stuff (because she assumes I'm gonna just throw it out as I don't have space for it in my new flat), so I say fine, I'll just pick up my stuff. Then she's like why don't you sell it to me for cheap.....I say how cheap....she's like I'll give you 200 bucks for all of it (this is a dryer, a microwave, a couch , a computer desk, a coffee table and a bedside table). I was like that's ridiculous.....It's worth like 1K+. Then she's really shows her teeth....she's like 'Ohhh I've had to do so much work here and this is broken and that was broken so you give me your stuff for this much or you come and do all the repair/painting work yourself.' and she's basically telling me that I've destroyed her house and I need to repair the whole thing.  Now she's holding my deposit as well as my stuff hostage and saying that everything in the house needs to be changed/repaired.......what the hell do I do? Can I go to the police or some sort of consumer court?   **TLDR:** Landlady is not returning my deposit and my stuff in the house worth about 1K.

Flying in at 1:30 AM? Food? Beer?,"Super excited, just purchased tickets flying in to Singapore for the first time.  Only caveat is that our flight lands at 1:30 AM on a Saturday morning/Friday night.  I'm assuming cabs will be readily available at that time, I mean, there are flights coming in, so cabs should be there, right?Any idea on cab fare into city center at that time, and next question: payment.  Are there ATM's in the airport?  Would cab driver accept US$ as payment?  Should I have my bank get some SGD for me before we fly to avoid this whole issue?Its my first trip to Asia, but the wife has been a couple times, so we should be fine.  I've been to 25 other countries, so not travel novice by any means, but is there anything specific to Singapore that we should be aware of?We don't have a hotel booked, but we are looking for something in the US$100 range per night, is that completely unrealistic? If so we can pump up budget and cut on accomodation prices later in Thailand. AirCon is not a concern for us, it dries me out and after a day or two in the heat I always seem to manage.  We went to Nicaragua last year and it was hot and steaming the whole time and I loved it.  No stranger to hot weather, at least not on vacation.I read the sidebar stuff and people seem to recommend Geylang for good casual food, which is perfect.  I don't want to eat anywhere with a tablecloth if I can avoid it.One last question- I will be on vacation from a high-stress job with a 50-60 hour work week, so I will be putting down some beers for sure.  What's the average price for a cold one in a normal bar/restaurant?  Not talking about Raffles prices or anything, rather a plastic chair type of place.  No ambiance needed or wanted, particularly.  Also, any insight on a food budget for two people, per day?  We are looking at hawker centers/casual places exclusively.We've got several months until we come, but very excited and any info is appreciated!ThanksEdit: forgot to ask.  For a 1:30 arrival, I'm guessing we should have a hotel booked for Friday night?  I imagine after customs/baggage/etc we won't be arriving until 2:30-3:00 AM or so...  We will have been flying for 20 hours, so probably will be dog tired, so waiting around until the morning to save a few $$$ isn't worth it really.  Any insight?

r/Singapore. Please help me. I need some help and/or legal advice. Tell me what I can do. Thank you!,"Hi r/singapore,I am currently facing a very big problem. It's a bit of a long story so please bear with me. A little bit of background first: My mum and dad has been divorced for many years. At the moment, my 3-room flat home is still under my mum's and dad's name. The Order of Court for the divorce (Court Order) indicates that the flat has to be sold at an open market. My mum and dad say that is not what they agree on with the lawyer. They were uneducated and did not know why/how did the lawyer even wrote that court order. (That is what they tell me) Anyway, I live with my mum and my dad only contacts me. He does gives the family money (Alimony to my mum, even though he gave less than the indicated amount on the court order). My family has been facing financial problems since I was 10-11. I am 24 this year. My younger brother is 20 this year and he is in army at the moment. I am currently finishing my studies this year on September. I study at CGProtege in 3D Modelling in Games and Animation.Last year, my dad got into an accident. It was his fault, and has to pay the damages to the other party involved. I am not too sure about the details as my dad did not want to tell me much even though I asked him repeatedlyAll I know is, they issue a Writ Of Seizure to my house. I know what is that because I already experienced it when i was 15. They come in, paste stickers on whatever items that is of value, and then auction off. Attempts to remove these items are illegal. Now they haven't paste the stickers. Only the letter warning the Writ Of Seizure has been issued. When I was 15, I have nothing at home of value except a refrigerator and a television. So back then, I didn't really care. I just let them take, bought a second hand tv and (where the new fridge came from I forgot, I heard my dad got it from someone, but I can't remember)Anyway, now, I am going to experience it again. This time, I have many things that I worked hard for to get them. I saved money to built my own computer, and a laptop that my younger brother and me saved up for a year to buy. I am working part time and studying at the same time. I have no receipt or anything at all to prove all these items are mine. The flat is still under my mum's and dad's name and I understand the Court is legally allowed to seize items in my house. If it was a gaming computer, playstation or whatever, I really don't care. Just let them seize and move on with my life. However, I have no extra money to buy a new computer. I need this computer to do my assignment as all of them are digital work (3D modelling) Right now, I need some legal advice. I don't know what can the Legal Aid Bureau do, and even so LAB will take time and by then, I do not know whether or not I can still keep my computer for my work. It is my livelihood at the moment. I am making a living from it. My situation is at a disadvantage. Firstly, court order has indicate that the house is going to be sold on open market but my parents did not do so because that is not what they wanted. The court order is now being varied (meaning its going to be changed through Legal Aid Bureau) So no matter what I do, this home is still under my dad's name, meaning he has asset in this flat. Secondly, the accident was my dad's fault, so the other party is legally allowed to claim compensation from my dad. Thirdly, I have nothing to prove anything that is in my flat that is of value, belongs to me. I got no receipt of any of them. I hope someone can advice me on what I can do next. All I can think of is, moving all my stuff to another relative place but there is no one who is willing to help us. None of my relatives wants to help us. I don't want to sound weak and sobbing, but it has been bothering for a week now and I have come to a point of breaking down. I have no one to talk to. My mum and younger brother does not know this yet. I just thought maybe I can try my luck here, someone who is well verse in law or know a lawyer to help or advice me. I know this next request might seems outrageous (Sorry...) but if anyone has a place for me to move my stuff temporarily to live in until all this over, I will appreciate it. I don't need a bed or room. Just a small space for my valuable stuff and a electric socket. I can sleep on the floor and willing to fork out certain amount for utilities. If not, it's okay, sorry for such an outrageous request.I will also post proof to show that I am not making this story up.

"how does health care work in singapore, digging into some details?","i'm curious as to how some of the specifics of their system works. some info (from wikipedia)&gt; Singapore has a non-modified universal healthcare system where the government ensures affordability of healthcare within the public health system, largely through a system of compulsory savings, subsidies and price controls. Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions to provide subsidies within a nationalized health insurance plan known as Medisave. Within Medisave, each citizen accumulates funds that are individually tracked, and such funds can be pooled within and across an entire extended family. The vast majority of Singapore citizens have substantial savings in this scheme. One of three levels of subsidy is chosen by the patient at the time of the healthcare episode.&gt; A key principle of Singapore's national health scheme is that no medical service is provided free of charge, regardless of the level of subsidy, even within the public healthcare system. This mechanism is intended to reduce the overutilisation of healthcare services, a phenomenon often seen in fully subsidised universal health insurance systems. Out-of-pocket charges vary considerably for each service and level of subsidy. At the highest level of subsidy, although each out-of-pocket expense is typically small, costs can accumulate and become substantial for patients and families. At the lowest level, the subsidy is in effect nonexistent, and patients are treated like private patients, even within the public system.&gt; The increasingly large private sector provides care to those who are privately insured, foreign patients, or public patients who are able to afford what often amount to very large out-of-pocket payments above the levels provided by government subsidies.&gt; Approximately 70-80% of Singaporeans obtain their medical care within the public health system. Overall government spending on healthcare amounts to only 3-4% of annual GDP, partly because government expenditure on healthcare in the private system is extremely low.&gt; The government regularly adjusts policies to actively regulate ""the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country"" in an attempt to keep costs in check. However, for the most part the government does not directly regulate the costs of private medical care. These costs are largely subject to market forces, and vary enormously within the private sector, depending on the medical specialty and service provided.The specific features of the Singapore healthcare system are unique, and have been described as a ""very difficult system to replicate in many other countries."" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.means tested subsidies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore#Means_testing_in_Singapore_hospitalsso what i am curious about, is how does this all work together?* the means testing has 5201 and above - does that mean all people get at least this base level of subsidy?* do these subsidies exist for hospital care only?* what is class A? no subsidy? what is an example of a difference between an A B or C level remedy/service?* what has a price control around it and what doesn't? ie. checkup, sore throat, wart removal, MRI, cancer treatment?* what gets subsidies among this group of health items?* what if anything is completely market priced among it?* is the public catastrophic insurance (medishield) just government set rates are based on actuarial data beyond gender/age?* what do parallel/additional private insurance offer?* can public catastrophic insurance be exhausted to a maximum benefit point under a chronic condition (and put one into medifund, financial safety net)? or is it perpetually available? * how are drugs priced?i'd like to better understand the details of how tools like controls and markets are actually used there.",False,,,,

The bouncers from the club then got 3 other bouncers and then kicked me out and told me it was not my business and to go home cause the guy was her B.F. Never going to this club again. Hope this goes further than just /singapore*edit* some clarification (morning after). Went ape shit might be an exaduration. I was in a lift and i told the guy to back away, he exited the lift and i was asking the girl if she was OK. Lift went back up the 1 story she got out and ran into the womens bathroom. I then asked a female friend of mine to go in and check on her and went to speak to the bouncers in the meatime. I think the guy was obviously well known there. As soon as i described the guy they seemed to know who he was and told me he was her B.F and it was none of my business and I should probably leave. I was then herded to the lift again. ",False,,,,
Canadian Lawyer with a career question,"Hello and thanks for reading. Several years ago I worked in Korea teaching English, and I had a blast. I have been doing preliminary research for job opportunities in Asia. I researched Asian countries, and Singapore scored very high on most of my criteria (treatment of foreigners, quality of life, safety, very low corruption etc). I am a Caucasian Canadian lawyer with little work experience (1 year) and entertaining options to work abroad. I only speak English, and would prefer to work in a career related to my field. I have read expat forums that weren't particularly helpful. I'm wondering if someone like me were to look for an opportunity to a career in Singapore, what are common challenges I may face? What will be expected of me? If you were in my position, what things would you do to increase your chances of finding a satisfying career?Thanks in advance!

"Really tough shituasian. Any advice, reddiporeans?","This is possibly the most messed-up situation of my entire life. My fiancé and I have been together 3 years. He is a US citizen Singaporean ex-PR who gave up his PR to go to a top Ivy League school, never thinking he'd ever come back (he thought his US citizen SPR parents would join him in America after he left but they did not, in fact, his mum is now applying for SG citizenship. He was born and raised entirely in Singapore).As fate would have it, I recently got into medical school in Singapore. It is my only acceptance. I fell in love with the city when I went on exchange last year. My fiancé only realized when living in America that Singapore is the place for him. He has tried for 2 years to get a job in America to no avail. His field is currently saturated and the government in USA and Canada are cutting it drastically. His dad has connections in Singapore, where he lived 30 years, and as a result my fiance received a handful of job offers in Singapore, where his field is burgeoning. He likely cannot get an employment pass, and even if he can, he would risk getting refused when applying for subsequent passes.He decided to just suck it up a do NS. Although he is not an army person, he realizes that prospects are way better for us in Singapore than in America. Then his parents spoke to a lawyer and the lawyer said that they are unlikely to forgive him or even allow him to do NS for pardon because they are worried it is unfair to allow PRs to purposely go to college, and do NS after when that is expressly forbidden to citizens. We think it is silly to permanently penalize him for a mistake he made as an immature, idealistic kid, and who'd have thought his ang mo girlfriend would have brought him back? But we think it is for the best, provided he is allowed to live like a normal person (go to get a masters, get a job, etc.)Moreover, his father is 80 years old and his health deteriorated a lot after my fiancé left for America. He is heartsick for his dad who spends long hours very lonely and often needs assistance to do simple tasks. His mum works long hours to support the family and pay his dad's medical bills and his Ivy League education. In the interests of filial piety in his dad's old age, he wants to come back.Does anyone have any advice for us? Are our dreams of settling and raising a family in Singapore ruined forever? This is my only chance to become a doctor and I love the program and want to live in Singapore, as does he. I have many friends I made during my exchange whom I am regularly in touch with and the quality of life cannot be beat.Any advice for a desperate soon-to-be reddiporean?**TL;DR: fiancé gave up PR to avoid NS so that he could go to an Ivy League school in the states, thinking his parents would follow him and that he'd never come back. Now he and I want to go back and settle there. His parents' lawyer said he is unlikely to even be able to serve NS to get his PR back or even get an EP/SP. is the lawyer right?

Pinched nerve in the neck causing shoulder pain. Need advice.,"Hi,I am a 25 year old female expat professional and I have come to this website for some advice. In January I did an MRI and got diagnosed with one cervical degenerated herniated disk (+ two mild ones). Since then I have been suffering shoulders and arms pain. I went for physiotherapy treatment (spine specialist) which gave me no relief (except to my wallet...). I also tried osteopath, massage, acupressure which weren't of much help either.Acupuncture combined with a massage made me feel better temporarily, but only for the first time.I obviously want to avoid the surgery, but I don't know how to manage the pain (other than taking pain killers).For some context, my work is quite stressful and involves being on the  computer 10 hours per day.Therefore I would like to ask if anyone here has had a similar problem or knows someone who has been in a position as mine. If yes, how are they dealing with it? Any help on treatment, good practitioners, conventional measures etc would be really helpful.In addition, my insurance will not cover me for further physiotherapy sessions, so I would appreciate a solution that is worth the money.Thank you very much.

Help NTU Undergrads Fight Food Insecurity in Urban Slums!,"We are a team of like-minded NTU undergraduates, from different cultures and academic backgrounds, who share a passion for social entrepreneurship. We have pooled in all our competencies to develop our solution to eliminate the problem of food insecurity.Our idea, Unn, aims at eliminating food insecurity in urban slums through a revolutionary ""four hand model"". Your vote can help us bring this social enterprise to life! To vote us, please go to this page, and vote for the ""Unn"" video.www.ProjectUnn.comThanks Guys! To learn more about us, continue reading on._________________________________________________________In our world, 1 in every 7 people lack access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. Out of these people who are food insecure, 1 in every 4 live in the urban slums. This means that 200 million people living in urban slums are trapped in the vicious circle of food insecurity.At unn, we propose a four hand model for solving this problem. Unn will establish a centralized body which will act as a hub for food distribution, uniting the slum families with a common goal, empowering them and providing them with social recognition in the society. So how will Unn accomplish this?The process starts with UNN procuring nutritious and fresh food directly from the farmers, thus eliminating the middlemen and avoiding the usual 400% price increase. The farmers will inform UNN once their supply is ready through mobile technology, and then based on the supply from the farmers a dynamic collective chain will be determined accordingly. This will empower the farmers to get a better price for their produce, provide the slum families with affordable and nutritious food and finally, optimize the supply chain by means of a combination of mobile technology and micro level demand aggregation.UNN will ensure storage of optimal quantities of grain and forward the fresh produce directly to the slum families to avoid wastage through small franchise shops established near the slum clusters. The slum families will be required to register through biometrics at the UNN franchise shops which will enable UNN to set-up individual accounts for each of the slum families and develop an intensive database. Along with the cheap food, slum families will be further incentivised to become evangelists of UNN through UNN points. Instead of fighting the plague of food insecurity alone, the slum families will be encouraged to unite and collectively solve this problem within their slums. Thus, UNN will create a sustainable model of fast paced growth and scalability.UNN will also act as a platform to partner with NGOs/FTOs to empower slum families. These organizations will conduct educational and training programs to raise awareness about nutritious food and impart life-long skills, such as basket making, carpentry etc., to the slum families. Slum families will then sell their finished products to NGOs through UNN. In return for their goods, UNN will credit UNN points to the individual family’s UNN account. A fraction of the UNN points earned will be exchangeable for cash while the remaining will be kept aside as savings and for certain fixed vital expenses like education and healthcare. On behalf of the slum families, UNN will invest an amount equivalent to the aggregated savings points into Grameen banks which will earn interest and multiply their savings overtime. In this way, UNN will be able to provide a constant source of income through a sustainable savings model and counter food insecurity for the slum families.The database developed by UNN throughout the process will serve as a valuable asset for corporations. UNN will provide them with a platform to reach a socially un-recognized consumer class and an enormous resource for the labour market.UNN’s four-hand model will be a paradigm shift in breaking the vicious circle of poverty and providing food sovereignty for urban slum families by creating an ecosystem which is sustainable, scalable and fast-growing.",False,,,,

Why Singaporean internet sucks so badly,"Hi, I'm a computer programmer who lived in Singapore for a year, and suffered your atrocious peak time bandwith on both Singtel and Starhub. Yet Singapore actually provides really amazing local internet infrastructure, far above the quality of much of the rest of the world.So why is your internet connection so slow?It's really simple, Singaporean ISPs have to purchase ""bandwith"" from other companies to send your internet traffic overseas. Unfortunately, you only have a choice between 3 large providers for the most part (there are smaller ISPs) and with this monopoly the ISPs have all realised, they *don't need to buy more international bandwith*.Yep, they know absolutely what's wrong, and it's a trivial matter for any network engineer to prove exactly what the problem is. Yet what are they going to do about it? They're going to ignore all of your complaints, for 5 years.When I see that Singapore is upgrading local WiFi to 4G, I have to laugh. It's like living in a country where you have amazing 5-lane motorways running through the entire city, yet the one road everyone wants to take is a single lane dirt track.So, how come sometimes access to international sites isn't pitifully slow? Hey, this ""James Pike"" guy is talking nonsense! Well... this is because of a cache, where lots of Singaporean machines will copy data people accessed from abroad and keep it locally for a short while. Then subsequent requests for this overseas content will be delivered from the local cache at a higher speed.So, if you're watching a video popular with Singaporeans, say some EPL, you'll likely get it from the cache at a high speed. But say you have unusual tastes, or you are watching something unpopular, this is when your speed crawls to snails pace.I don't get any Karma for this post (it's a ""self"" post) but I consider it of absolute importance to raise awareness on this issue.I really hope, if enough of you guys complain, you can make the ISPs finally buy a bit more international bandwith. It shouldn't be, that a country with much better local infrastructure than the UK has such worse speeds.",False,,,,

Here is my experience doing just that.So you see, a few weeks ago, my classmate (/u/RanDoMEz) told me about the event ""Bare Your Soles"" that will be held this year. I was quite interested in finding out why it was conducted so I began finding more information about it. It is quite sad for those who cannot afford basic footwear, and I wholly support the cause.As I was trawling the interwebs, I also began to see that there were health benefits by traveling barefoot (FEET DON'T SMELL, toes are not squashed together, they grow more naturally, feet become stronger, circulation in feet improves and more), not to mention the freedom you get.So, today, I plucked up the courage to travel home barefoot. And my word, it was one of *the* most freeing things I have ever done. Feeling the different textures beneath your feet, the temperature of the ground, the air flowing past your feet. It is wonderful. Yes, being from a top school in Singapore, I did get a few weird looks, but since I was with a friend, I ignored these looks and continued talking and laughing. I felt so free. It truly is wonderful to do that, I highly recommend everyone trying it one day.

I just graduated from Singapore Polytechnic and thinking of becoming a web designer/front-end developer here. Any web designer from around here, local or moved from overseas?Problem is, I am enlisting for army soon. Went for a few interview as a temp, 3-5 months and nobody hired me because of enlistment. DAMN I had to start my own freelance work and things aren't going well. I do not get work often but hey when I get the work, I go full force at it. At the same time, every client I meet wants me to charge LOW. Really? I did not take a part time job waiting tables etc because it's a free time for me to actually get right down into it and improve myself with web designing, developing and lurking around web_design. And I am thinking of working elsewhere in other country where web designers are actually useful and treasured, example USA, Australia.

People are willing to pay a price for having their site developed while in Singapore they just want cheap.Most people want cheap designers/dev here and it's really not helping me in terms of paying bills etc. Are things better on your side after getting a full time job?

Now usually for this center, the utensils come in disposable chopsticks + spoons, but for this particular stall, it gave proper plastic ones with a metallic spoon. Now, the lady taking my order said the wait will be ~25mins, and I was fine with it, considering it was one of the few seafood places open. She spoke perfect English (comparatively) and very eloquent. I told her I didn't want a plate of rice. The food arrived a little over 35mins - wasn't really surprised because it was crowded; I didn't really complain because I was entertaining myself with a beer. When the Kang Kong came (one of the best I have tried, not drenched in chilli oil and had a lot of hehbei), I asked for a plate of rice, and when the Sting-Ray came, mum wanted another serving of the chincharlok - to which there was no hesitation. Upon paying, she charged us $16 - 6 for Kangkong and 10 for Sting Ray, and no charge for the rice. Naturally, I insisted on paying for it; and here's the kicker, she said, ""It's ok, you waited so long, the rice is ok, plus its only 1 bowl of rice. We don't charge for one.""I don't know whether it was because of what she said but the food ended up to be pretty awesome (it was not the hunger talking) and I know the stall has achieved a returning customer.

Namely that it (well, certain things closely associated with it, for a man at least) is illegal and punishable by up to two years' imprisonment. Maybe even worse...I wasn't sure.My question is, is this law enforced; do people actually go to jail over this? Also, what is being gay like in Singapore? Do you have to be in fear of being caught by the police, or worse, entrapped? Is it possible to have a normal relationship with another guy there? If you ""keep it to yourself"" is there any risk?Thanks Reddit for clearing some of this up.",False,,,,

I need to sell Japanese Eels in Singapore or my company may likely fail. Reddit is just weird enough that I thought you might appreciate the challenge....Only 3 questions...! (Xpost from AskReddit),"We have a translation/promotion company. Our competition is 108 Bank.. THE BIGGEST BANK IN JAPAN! The client is one of the biggest EEL RESTAURANT CHAINS IN JAPAN!We can do a better job of selling their eels in Singapore. I am sure that we can. But this meeting was a bit of a surprise and it is happening in 15 hours. I think we can get the gig and survive for another year IF.... if I can get some information. And that is what Reddit does best.Any general help would be much appreciated, but here are some specific questions:• I know that Singaporeans often speak in Singlish. Is it better if the advertisements are written in Singlish or Standard Singapore English? Obviously, they want to sell to the most number of people. However, if an ad written in Singlish lowers the perceived value of the product, given that this product is presumably targeted at the wealthy, perhaps exquisitely proper English is in order.• I did some searching and noticed that many Singapore sites refer to eels as ""snake like things"".... Really? Don't most Singaporeans know what 'eel' means? Do they need ""snake like thing""? I would think that most folks would not want to eat a snake like thing. However, I have heard that many Singaporeans have an appetite for aphrodisiacs and thus may appreciate the 'snake like' quality. Is this true??• If you live in Singapore... what would make you want to try this eel? ANY help at all here would be much appreciated!Edit:  Thank you reddit!  We got the gig, we got the gig!  I was able (with just 10 hours notice?) to speak as if I at least had an 'inkling' of what I was talking about.  This is due to all your excellent ideas, most of which I mentioned. I can't think of any other way I could have done this.  Thanks again to all!",False,,,,

Possibly moving to Singapore and have some questions!,"Hey fellow Redditors!My wife and I are Australian and currently living in NYC, we have been here for the past 3 years and looking at moving back to Australia but the option of heading to Singapore has also been put in front of me. I did a search of this sub-reddit and found a lot of info which was helpful but I have some specific questions.1. Does anyone know a good online calculator for income? I found this one http://calculatenetsalary.com/calculate-net-salary-in-singapore.html but it only seems to do Tax and I have read things about CPF payments etc. Are there any other hidden payments/taxes I should be aware of? I want to ensure I can calculate what my income will be accurately so I can make a good decision.2. I will be getting paid pretty well but obviously rent is very expensive in Singapore, can anyone point me at some good sites to find rentals? So far I found this which looks pretty good, http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/ I've been looking at 2br places that are around $3000-4000 in certain areas just out of the city(10-15). Does that sound reasonable or am I absolutely kidding myself with that price range? We don't mind a 1BR either. If anyone can point out some decent areas near the MRT that would be handy, So Far I like around Novena/Newton, Bugis and out towards Queenstown, Holland village etc. 3. I know you can live in HDBs and Apartments/Condos. If I was to live in a HDB am I going to feel like a stranger in some crazy land or will other locals living in the building not care? Any expats on here that live in a HDB? They seem to be WAY cheaper so as long as its legal i'm not fussed really as long as I don't feel like a prisoner there.I should add I've been to Singapore twice for work (for a week at a time) around 3-4 years ago and loved the place, especially the food etc. My wife and I have always loved SE Asia so I have a bit of an idea what the culture and Singapore itself is like. If any expats what to give opinions on their stays and experiences feel free to comment.Thanks in advance and sorry if this is annoying!

BREAKING: Arrests made in Saturday's slashing case at Singapore's Orchard #Cineleisure mall. Details to come,nan,False,,,,
"Met this guy the other day, not sure what to think. Would appreciate your thoughts :)","So this dude comes up to me at the mall and says he wanted to talk because I caught his eye, and we strike up a conversation for 5-10 minutes. He asks about my background, where I'm from, yadda yadda...at the end he asks to exchange phone numbers and meet next weekend at a cafe. As a foreigner here I've been looking to get to know the locals so I think, hey, I just made a new friend.Here's where it gets a little odd. Not five minutes after he leaves he calls, and I think he just butt-dialed me so I let it go. But that day and the day after he calls/texts me every single day, and when I don't answer immediately he makes some remark about how it must be the ""foreigner way"" to ""call multiple times before you answer"". Now I don't know if it's common here to be that clingy or if he's just super friendly, but to be honest I'm getting a little creeped out. Not to mention some of the things he said doesn't seem quite right - is it possible to be in the Army and be working in the business/finance sector at the same time? Anyway please let me know what you guys think! Since it's my first time here and I don't really know any people in Singapore besides my coworkers/host family, idk if I'm just being paranoid or not. Thanks!",False,,,,

My owner is an asshole. How can I ensure I get my security deposit back?,"Hi, Reddiporeans.My boyfriend is currently the main tenant of a 3 bed/2 bath HDB flat.  At the beginning of the 12 month agreement, I was in one common room, another girl was in the other common room, and my bf was in the master room.  From the beginning, we have had a lot of problems with the owner. The original agreement was for two-years, but the day that my bf was supposed to sign the lease, the owners announced that their HDB request to rent for two years had been rejected.  It was another two weeks and a small miracle before they obtained permission to rent for 12 months.  The owner also does not provide anything for the upkeep of the apartment.  For example, he did not want to replace the bug-infested refrigerator, the broken TV, or the broken washing machine.  We had to do the repair work ourselves.  The apartment was a mess when we first moved in (dust everywhere, random things that the owner left in the apartment, and shitty furniture that was broken before we moved in).  The final straw came last month.  The owners are trying to sell the apartment, and as per our tenancy agreement, we had agreed on a time that we can be at the apartment to open the door to the agent to show it (usually every other weekend).  Last month, he and I were travelling on weekends, and could not open the door at the apartment.  The owners (who are living out-of-country), threatened to have their agent enter the premises while we were not present, and then claim that the agent wouldn't be responsible for any goods that may go missing.  This was not acceptable at all.  Since there had been a lot of contention on the topic over the previous months, my bf sent an email stating that we would not be available to show the apartment until the end of our agreement (late August, 2013), and told them not to enter the apartment without our permission.At this point, we do not trust the owners to return the $3500 deposit.  There is no serious damage to the apartment at all (just a few cosmetic details like touching up the paint and replacing their shitty toilet paper holders that fell off the wall), but we are afraid that they are bitter for all the contention about selling the apartment.**Since the deposit is equal to one month's rent, we simply want to use the deposit from the last month's rent and then pay out-of-pocket for any assessed damages at the hand-over.**Is this an acceptable way to handle the situation?  Or would this get us into trouble? Thank you!",False,,,,

This pass last for 3 months but my university states that I should at least stay for 5 months. the pass is non extendible and I don't have the right requirements for a Training Work Permit or a Work Holiday Pass.

Fellow redditor needs your advice.,"Hi All,I am going to Singapore for a work trip and sadly will only have about 4 hours free time to myself one afternoon before dinner.I was wondering if you only had that short amount of time, what you would recommend seeing? (IM getting very mixed opinions on Raffles etc..)Secondly, I am from the UK and collect designer toys, (WWR figures, Gundams etc..) and was wondering if they are cheaper over there and if so where to get them from.Thirdly, I keep reading about this smog, should I buy a mask before I go?!Lastly in terms of goodies to bring back, I am always looking for fairly unusual and unique things to bring back from trips abroad, and was wondering if anyone could recommend anything, (crazy alcohols, statues, art, etc...)
