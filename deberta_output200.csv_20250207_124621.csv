Switching to Starhub was a big mistake.,"I had recently switched to Starhub from Singtel. I was ok with the fact that they told me that they would port my number in 7-10 days. But after the tenth day, I realised my number still wasn't ported. I made a call to them regarding this and they gave the silly excuse that they're undergoing some system upgrade/maintainence. So I waited and waited. Finally they sent me a text saying that my number has been ported successfully. Problem solved? Not quite.I found out that I could make outgoing calls and send outgoing text. But neither incoming calls nor text are working for me. It's been 7 days and counting that I'm living with this problem.Their customer service has been giving me the run around; Each time I gave them a call, their response is always one of these: 1)We would check on the problem and give you a call back, which they never did. 2) We have resetted your line and it would work in 24hrs. Yea, right, we're still here aren't we.I'm contemplating going down to their service centre to cancel my service with them and return the phone for a full refund. I have been with Singtel and M1 and I have to say, this is really, really atrocious. How could you let your customer not be contactable for a week and blame all this on system upgrades? I really think some thing is wrong with their customer service and I don't think I will ever use them nor will I recommend them to my family and friends. Not after I describe to them my ordeal.What a nightmare!",False,,,,
